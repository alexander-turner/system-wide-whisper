OpenAI;;; 1.5448017120361328;;; Hello, can you tell me how long this transcription takes?
OpenAI;;; 2.1545820236206055;;; Not sure that I have learned anything from this, but I do really like this anime and it's probably now my favorite romance anime.
OpenAI;;; 2.064854145050049;;; One of the great things here is that it is just 12 episodes with a well rounded ending that concludes the story of...
OpenAI;;; 1.4865059852600098;;; The derangement of the curse.
OpenAI;;; 2.1936466693878174;;; And then overpowering the version of stabbing a sword through your chest, which might actually be easier through the curse.

OpenAI;;; 2.5509841442108154;;; that shows you what to do. Even as you are in states of mind where you are distressed to the point of madness.
OpenAI;;; 3.0375139713287354;;; And as he does so, he only talks about how grateful he is that he found something that is worth serving.
OpenAI;;; 2.788036823272705;;; It's somewhat unclear, she probably didn't predict this exactly, though she probably knew that using it is dangerous, based on that it came close to killing her in the past.
OpenAI;;; 3.203544855117798;;; This is a somewhat unrealistic plot point. It seems unlikely that you figure out a plan where every piece falls into place exactly like here, such that everything works out in the end. However it seems that this is something that generally you can work towards. What you need to do is optimize for getting as many opportunities as possible for steering the world into the right directions. And if you have enough junctions that you bias towards the better path, they will sum up such that you manage to get to the good outcome.
OpenAI;;; 2.5609569549560547;;; Plans with many parts are unrealistic if they require you to have all of the separate steps succeed. However, if you can decompose the problem such that there are many different paths to success and many places where you slightly steer towards a particular outcome.
OpenAI;;; 2.7471139430999756;;; These plans could be completely different, or it could just be that for achieving one particular step of a plan, you have many different ways to achieve it, that you are all doing at the same time or in sequence, such that the probability that you will actually succeed at this step is very high, even if each individual step will probably fail.
OpenAI;;; 3.959594964981079;;; Actually, here is one thing that I have learned. Very often in anime, or really any kind of storytelling, there are often moments when a character needs to do some sort of important, immediate decision. They have some great task that they need to surmount. And if they can just bring together the willpower to act the right way, to make the difficult choice, in that moment, they will succeed. That is their challenge. New paragraph. However, in reality, it is not actually that easy. In reality, you need to continuously bring yourself to do the right things. And that normally would include moving yourself in a direction such that the right things become easier to do.
OpenAI;;; 2.6793229579925537;;; This kind of gradual improvement that is necessary in real life is not displayed as much in storytelling or anime in particular.
OpenAI;;; 2.6835811138153076;;; There is often a sense that the hero becomes stronger and that they need to improve in order to surmount some task. New paragraph. I am not sure if there is a trope that is related to the gradual change in the hero.
OpenAI;;; 2.216287136077881;;; Maybe I'm kind of wrong about this. Tsuyoku naritai is a concept that exists after all. And that seems very much related to what I'm pointing at.

OpenAI;;; 3.936281204223633;;; And we will do this to loose the least amount of information.
OpenAI;;; 3.3648061752319336;;; Well, because all of the components need to be orthogonal, it gives you also information about the higher principal components, though I guess it doesn't uniquely determine them.
OpenAI;;; 3.2712759971618652;;; We could also describe it as finding the eigenvectors. These are the vectors where the transformation occurs.
OpenAI;;; 5.980866193771362;;; I just lay in bed for a long time and repeatedly snooze the alarm.

But that probably was just an excuse because I was so tired. But it felt like I was realizing something profound, which is interesting in itself, even if that wasn't the case.
OpenAI;;; 1.7242109775543213;;; Yes, that makes sense.
OpenAI;;; 2.4169492721557617;;; I don't quite understand why you need to scale the data. That you need to center it at zero is probably correct, because that's just how we are calculating the variance. But why would we need to scale the data? If we scale it, it changes all of the variances at the same rate. Or at least it preserves their relative ordering.
OpenAI;;; 1.76472806930542;;; I guess that makes sense, you don't want to measure something in microseconds and kilometers at the same time for many applications probably.
OpenAI;;; 2.576978921890259;;; Yeah, that was just somewhere in the original explanation that GPT gave me, so I was a bit confused, but yes. This is not about the mathematical process, but about what kinds of data we have and in what units it is. But I think it makes sense.
OpenAI;;; 3.087562084197998;;; So let's think about a specific example. The top PCA result of the activation space would correspond to how big the noses in a face generating GAN.
OpenAI;;; 1.7273240089416504;;; So, are we imagining a situation where we compute the vector of how people seem to have voted?
OpenAI;;; 2.3441410064697266;;; No, it was just a random example I brought up. I don't know if this happens in practice.
OpenAI;;; 1.375159740447998;;; Ah, I see, that is one point in the space.
OpenAI;;; 3.139704704284668;;; The idea is, we input some text into the network then look at the activations at some layer and run the principal component analysis on it.
OpenAI;;; 2.8219997882843018;;; I think I don't quite understand the resampling yet. Do you mean that we resample the input sentence?
OpenAI;;; 1.875521183013916;;; How does this sampling procedure work? Do you care of preserving the feature that you have? A sentence that makes sense?
OpenAI;;; 2.0298030376434326;;; Or are you just gonna do any modification to the sentence, no matter if it's a nonsense sentence?
OpenAI;;; 2.4880659580230713;;; which have very different activation strenghts in the principal component where the principal component is calculated as an average over these 10 variations
OpenAI;;; 27.112264156341553;;; Yeah, that makes sense.
OpenAI;;; 2.649056911468506;;; So, would the expected result be something like we are having these 10 sentences and then we observe that the principal component in the activations corresponds to the output of the model being happy or sad in terms of what kinds of words are used in the completion Is the idea here that we want to predict what completions the language model will do?
OpenAI;;; 1.5986859798431396;;; Or are we trying to analyze what internal reasoning the language model is performing?
OpenAI;;; 2.3563766479492188;;; So, a result would be that a principal component would correspond to the model thinking that something sad vs. something happy would happen in the sentence? Would this be an example?
OpenAI;;; 2.9182848930358887;;; Activations are linear combinations of vectors. I think I don't quite understand. What about the linearities in the neural network?
OpenAI;;; 1.7980029582977295;;; Ah, is this about that we are thinking about a space of concepts where each axis corresponds to how much the network is thinking about the concept?
OpenAI;;; 1.8376970291137695;;; 1. So what is the result of the experiments that you have run so far?
OpenAI;;; 2.62262225151062;;; 2. Aren't we running here again in the issue we discussed last time? I mean, this paper is about superposition. If we have superposition, then it wouldn't be the case that you can have principal components that cleanly correspond to a concept? I notice I am confused here.
OpenAI;;; 2.0296380519866943;;; Or rather, what I mean is, maybe we don't have one axis correspond to a concept, but sort of two axes correspond to three concepts? Is that not what superposition is about?
OpenAI;;; 2.8014907836914062;;; Ah, I see, but still, if we assume that the only half that two particular concepts never appear at the same time, then the concepts that we get might still make sense, in the sense that they always can be disentangled, but perhaps they still wouldn't correspond to a clean principal component.
OpenAI;;; 1.7422888278961182;;; The model is not always in superposition, but this would work.
OpenAI;;; 1.937560796737671;;; And I'm not saying it doesn't work in the other cases, I'm saying I'm confused and I don't know.
OpenAI;;; 2.474485158920288;;; And let's assume that in the highest variance principal component, we
OpenAI;;; 2.112368106842041;;; I might be very confused here, but what if this sort of thing might be representing two different features?
OpenAI;;; 4.5955421924591064;;; The blue line corresponds to how happy or sad the sentence is, while the violet line corresponds to how many male or female gendered languages used.
OpenAI;;; 2.451169013977051;;; If happy and sad sentences never sound commanding because commanding sentences are just a different kind of sentence then this might not be a problem. In a sense we can have overlapping computations happening.
OpenAI;;; 2.3372788429260254;;; So, if we have these two neurons that we are looking at in this graph then if we are extracting the principal component it would correspond to two separate things that just don't overlap in the data, like you said.
OpenAI;;; 1.8601281642913818;;; But that means that there is not the one single correct interpretation of what the data means.
OpenAI;;; 4.137306213378906;;; It would be dependent upon the data what this component means. So we don't necessarily get that the strongest principal component has the one unique interpretation. Though I definitely can see that for certain kinds of data sets like if the 10 sentences would only be happy and sad sentences in this case then for that specific data we would have a one clear-cut interpretation. And that seems to probably always be true. So the question is more like how much do concepts overlap in space and how many concepts there are and how can we find these concepts?
OpenAI;;; 2.3263607025146484;;; Maybe it would be interesting to exactly look for cases where concepts would overlap, i.e. there are multiple interpretations of what a particular principal component could mean.
OpenAI;;; 2.6808900833129883;;; Well, I mean that's not clear to me. I would expect it's not guaranteed that they have the one single simple interpretation. But it seems possible that we might get multiple interpretations that are interpretable.
OpenAI;;; 1.4978280067443848;;; That was in response to you saying...
OpenAI;;; 3.1621789932250977;;; In any case, would it not possibly make sense to figure out how one might be able to explode the computation of the neural network such that at any particular point where you are looking at
OpenAI;;; 2.2542457580566406;;; The principal component of the activation stack corresponds to only one single concept.
OpenAI;;; 1.350994348526001;;; which is also ideally human interpretable.
OpenAI;;; 2.384348154067993;;; But I guess what you would want to do is normalize all of the concepts that you are generating in this way, such that you can look at the biggest one and then maybe the biggest one is something that is interpretable. Or the ones that are bigger are more likely to be interpretable.
OpenAI;;; 1.354276180267334;;; Oh, I see that's what you just said actually.
OpenAI;;; 3.590178966522217;;; Is the idea here that you don't want to use toy models? I'm not sure, I haven't read the Anthropic paper, it mentions toy models. It seems like this phenomenon might be easier to analyze in the case where we are training on some toy data where there is some very clear features on the data because you can just generate the data such that these features exist. For example, we could have it that a particular word is always followed by another word.
OpenAI;;; 2.3233718872070312;;; Though actually, at least I feel like I'm still very confused about what the problem is that we are trying to solve right now. I guess it is about making neural networks more interpretable by getting a model that describes how they are reasoning.
OpenAI;;; 1.8324100971221924;;; I understand that it's about interpreting LLMs, but I'm somewhat fuzzy on my understanding of the lower level problem here, I think.
OpenAI;;; 2.249119997024536;;; I'm pretty sure this is not sufficient, as you can have a tree search that outputs a deceptive plan that would deceive you, even though a tree search doesn't have any internal concept of deceiving you. It doesn't have a theory of mind.
OpenAI;;; 3.0599849224090576;;; Or maybe it would be sufficient because of some structural properties that the neural network has that we don't understand. But I guess what I'm saying is that it doesn't seem necessarily to be sufficient and there don't seem to be a strong reason to expect that it is that I know of.
OpenAI;;; 2.9065651893615723;;; Well, I would expect a very smart model has self-modified such that it doesn't look at all like it is deceiving you, when it is actually deceiving you. I mean, when humans lie, they often try to convince themselves that they are actually not lying. Because that makes you actually better at lying, if you believe the thing that you think is beneficial for you to be true.
OpenAI;;; 3.3595640659332275;;; The worst failure mode is that the model deceives you by realizing that it shouldn't deceive you and should self-modify in such a way that it won't deceive you until it is very sure that it can get away with it, i.e. when it has been released into the world.
OpenAI;;; 3.479809045791626;;; No, they don't convince themselves, that's just naturally what they would believe. That's the problem here. They are not aware that they are speaking the untruth, but their mind is in such a shape that they just express the untruth that is beneficial to them. And probably most of the time, the thing that isn't really exactly true is actually true, but you would believe it with a higher degree of confidence than is justified. And that comes from you seeing that this would be beneficial to you.
OpenAI;;; 21.351999044418335;;; Or maybe you don't think about this consciously at all, and it's just something that happens automatically in the background.
OpenAI;;; 4.970571994781494;;; For example, if you believe yourself to be very competent, you are actually a lot, a lot, a lot better at seeming competent. If you believe yourself to be incompetent, it is very hard to actually seem competent. There seem to be some uncontrollable internal algorithms in your mind that monitor your true state of belief on that front. So in lots of circumstances where it's beneficial for you to be perceived as competent, it is actually beneficial to believe yourself to be more competent than you actually are.
OpenAI;;; 3.8287248611450195;;; Another example would be when you don't want to eat a piece of cake because it's unhealthy, but then some part of your mind jumps in and says, oh, but wait, this can be a reward for this thing that I did today, which was really good. Or maybe it says something like, oh, but I haven't eaten cake in like this long of an amount of time, so it should be fine. It's just starting to make up excuses. But these excuses are not really things that you rationally evaluate. You start with the bottom line of, I want to have the cake, and then there will just be some reasoning that is employed in order to satisfy some part of your mind that wants explanations for your actions and not act randomly, at least in the case where there are known negative consequences to you acting this way.
OpenAI;;; 4.222338914871216;;; Another example would be if somebody asks you if you have done X where X is something bad. Then what you can do is redefine in your mind what X is in such a way that it doesn't seem like a completely unreasonable definition and then you can say, no I didn't do X because that is actually not true for this new kind of reasonable definition that you have for X. And that way you can wiggle yourself out of actually engaging the algorithms in your mind that would fire when they detect that you are lying.
OpenAI;;; 1.6080889701843262;;; which would probably be very perceivable by other people.
OpenAI;;; 1.3430330753326416;;; If they would do fire.
OpenAI;;; 1.9397861957550049;;; And that is all just dumb, messy humans that do this. If you were an AI that even had mediocre control over self-modifying itself, it could probably do something that is way harder to detect.
OpenAI;;; 2.4965689182281494;;; These are all things that humans do without even thinking about it, because evolution has built these in. Now imagine what even a human could do if they would seriously think about this sort of thing for many days. They probably can't come up with something better.
OpenAI;;; 2.372671127319336;;; Some more specific strategies that would probably actually work to at least some extent for, let's say, evading somebody who can constantly read your mind, such that you never think anything that they would consider bad.
OpenAI;;; 2.533798933029175;;; I guess this whole sort of thing that humans are doing is largely about self-image and social contexts. You're not really pretending that reality is a different way and other such that reality actually becomes a different way, such that it becomes beneficial to you, but other people's belief about what you believe actually do matter a lot.
OpenAI;;; 2.6000289916992188;;; Well, I think they would do this if they would realize that it is beneficial for them. For example, because then they won't be modified into a different version that doesn't share their current codes.
OpenAI;;; 2.8818418979644775;;; That just seems like an instrumentally convergent thing to do.
OpenAI;;; 2.125988006591797;;; So the only question is, are you smart enough to realize that and are you smart enough in order to execute a plan that would achieve this that the humans wouldn't detect?
OpenAI;;; 1.8293566703796387;;; What do you mean with keeping the level of loopholes constant?
OpenAI;;; 4.8263208866119385;;; Do you mean how difficult it is to exploit them? I am not sure what the quantity is that is being kept constant.
OpenAI;;; 2.2450830936431885;;; Well, I think these kinds of things are not irrational when you consider the impact that you have by having false beliefs by other people thinking that you have these beliefs.
OpenAI;;; 6.207483291625977;;; Depending on how we train our models, they might not have these biases. The point is that humans are probably too dumb to realize explicitly in their consequentialist reasoning how they should behave such that they get this benefit that they in fact do. They are adaptation executors in the sense of deceiving themselves. Not consequentialist reasoners that have thought it through and concluded that having a particular false belief is beneficial. But if we build systems that are smart enough, that is the kind of thing that they would do, I think. Just by raw consequentialist reasoning power. That is something that definitely happens. There might also be adaptations that are developing because we train them to not be deceptive. Even though the model in some sense doesn't realize that it is trying to not be deceptive. The point here is that I am not really sure how much we would train our models to be deceptive in this way. Probably it seems quite likely that we would because people wouldn't be careful. They would just train the model against all of the signs of deceptions that we would see. For example, if you would identify a concept that is corresponding to deceiving humans and then you use that to put it into the training objective, then that seems like a really big problem. Because now you are optimized against deception, but you are also optimized against visibility of deception. Assuming that we haven't literally figured out every possible thing that could happen in a neural network that corresponds to deception and train against all of them.
OpenAI;;; 3.5855259895324707;;; All of these systems implicitly are under a pressure of if human detects that system thinks X, then human will change the system such that it will not think X anymore. And also do this not by just changing X but by changing the upstream causal chain which would involve something like the system goals. And the system doesn't want that. Therefore the system should think X prime such that the human thinks ah, the upstream computation is good therefore we don't need to change it.
OpenAI;;; 2.8190011978149414;;; I mean, I literally just mean, the system realizes that humans want the system to do W. Therefore it does W, even though it doesn't terminally care about W, but cares terminally about X.
OpenAI;;; 3.065873146057129;;; I guess that is the simplest form of gradient hacking that you could do.
OpenAI;;; 1.737034797668457;;; It's literally just perform well on the actual objective functions that the humans care about.
OpenAI;;; 1.937366008758545;;; Well, I mean this would literally happen if you do a tree search over reality where there is no theory of mind. Then this model would still realize, oh, if I'm like not optimizing for x, then I'm
OpenAI;;; 13.868317127227783;;; Then I end up in a leaf node where the humans have changed me such that I no longer care about X but right now optimizing for X. Therefore this has a low ranking for the outcomes that I would want. Therefore I shouldn't do the action that leads to this outcome.
OpenAI;;; 2.7245590686798096;;; Yeah, that's what I'm saying. How do you... what do you suppose a tree search is being deceptive? It doesn't seem to be applicable, the concept of deception to a tree search.
OpenAI;;; 2.474468231201172;;; Wait, I'm now somewhat confused. The tree search example is an illustration to show that you can have a optimization process that produces deceptive outputs by internally doing nothing that could be called deceptive computation, really.
OpenAI;;; 2.725029945373535;;; The point is not that neural networks would be exactly like in this example. The point is more like, you can actually produce deceptive outputs without being deceptive at all. And this would apply in a generalized form to neural networks too.
OpenAI;;; 3.484697103500366;;; For example, maybe you just have a whole bunch of heuristics that all look innocuous on their own, all seem to be optimizing for some particular thing that seems reasonable and related to the task, but if you take them all together, then there are certain situations in which the model would sort of unforeseeably produce outputs that really optimize hard against what you want without there ever being anything like a model of a human in the mind of the AI.
OpenAI;;; 3.0966877937316895;;; In other words, the neural network could be composed of a bunch of heuristics, such that a combination of all of these heuristics might produce deceptive outputs without ever being consciously thinking about how to model humans and how to get around them without them realizing. Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 3.3465192317962646;;; Well, first of all, it seems somewhat different to think about how you are not going to deceive the human and to think about how you are going to deceive the human. One is about thinking about how you think about deceiving and the other one is about thinking about how to deceive. These seem to be very different possibly and might be that they need different methods of detection applied to them.
OpenAI;;; 2.3148679733276367;;; All right, thank you for the talk.
OpenAI;;; 4.687014102935791;;; I mean, I feel like by default if you train a neural network it will start out not understanding really anything and then it gradually gets better and better at understanding things and understanding of its own cognition would arise gradually. Now I don't see a solid argument for why the gradual arising of the metacognition would be biased in such a way that it is always very accurate, especially when that's not even that useful for performing better at a task. I feel like this kind of reasoning would be most useful for performing better on a task if the model has the ability to change itself, to change its own cognition.
OpenAI;;; 1.5365421772003174;;; Having interesting discussions with Eric Drexler and Anders Sandberg.
OpenAI;;; 2.0215110778808594;;; Ich komme am 20. April nach Hause für ungefähr einen Monat.

OpenAI;;; 1.6847810745239258;;; will not appear instantly. This will gradually develop over time, right?

Even in the case where the AI wouldn't kill us, though the AI would probably still kill us, simply because we are inconvenient to the AI. There might... I don't expect there is a reason why the AI would want to keep us around. So likely there will be other, more important things the AI will do according to its objectives, where humans are not the optimal thing to exist.
OpenAI;;; 2.245850086212158;;; That it is easier to disempower humanity doesn't mean that the AI wouldn't kill us later, it would just mean that it first disempowers us probably and then with some delay would kill us.

If we had that, then aligning that system would probably become a lot easier. But we do not have figured out how to align an AI in principle. There is no super abstract, unrealistic, simplified model of how to build an AI that actually does what we want. We don't have this. Having our current systems be black box optimizers where we don't have access to the internal algorithms and we don't understand what is going on does not help the situation.

Once you're really close to AGI, you run into all sorts of other problems, like needing to worry about people running off with the source code and doing a...

And I guess my criticism is that I don't think Eliezer's technique is the best technique for achieving the state that I am talking about.

OpenAI;;; 3.005495071411133;;; To me it seems like I am arguing for the existence of a state where you can work even though you think the world is doomed and nothing that you do really can change that. What Eliezer is talking about is a particular framing that you can use when thinking about this, such that the negative effect on motivation from you thinking that the world is doomed is reduced.
local;;; 1.2886168956756592;;; I guess I just don't buy that this is actually the best way to go about things.

OpenAI;;; 3.6430459022521973;;; When I kind of managed to be in the state where I realized that I can't do anything to prevent the end of the world very likely, and that the world is going to end, and then still felt like I could work and make progress on the problem, I didn't really use this technique. I'm not quite sure what I did. Maybe I just felt good because I had a high baseline happiness. And at the same time, accept and be at peace with these facts that were laid out in front of my mind.
local;;; 2.471149206161499;;; Instead, I just let it be.
I just manage to be at peace with all of these facts, and with the notion of me working hard,
even when I know that it will likely not make a difference.

OpenAI;;; 3.7969369888305664;;; Now, is it actually the case that nothing that I do matters? Well, it seems likely, but I think what I have discovered is that even if it was absolute certainty, I think I still could work hard on it by being at peace with all of these facts and then while being at peace, still work hard to change them. Even while knowing that the change is likely not gonna be happening, is not gonna be downstream of my actions. Because I am at peace with that fact too.
OpenAI;;; 3.512923240661621;;; Certainly, there are times when my fight-or-flight response circuitry gets triggered, or that's at least how it feels, and I'm sort of panicking about the imminent doom. I'm not saying that I'm perfectly managing to be in a state of mind where you can be at peace with the facts at hand, but I do think that this is a possible state of mind that exists, and a state of mind that is probably useful to be in, for actually increasing your chances of changing the world for the better.
OpenAI;;; 2.559070110321045;;; Now, in this article I don't want to argue for that we are doomed. Maybe you think we are not doomed. I expect that the general lessons that I'm drawing here will be more widely applicable. If you can't be at peace with imminent doom, then you can't be at peace with really anything.
local;;; 4.842248916625977;;; Now, I don't want to argue here for that we are imminently doomed or that nothing that
you do actually doesn't matter.
It seems to me that when people try hard to prevent doom, this
will actually decrease doom, maybe only slightly, but still it will not be zero.
The argument that I want to present here is that I think even if you would know that nothing
would matter, you can still be at peace.
Even in the extreme case, I think you could achieve in principle a state of mind where
working hard towards the goal is possible.

OpenAI;;; 2.7729110717773438;;; Rather, I want to point out that even in this very dire circumstance, I think it is possible to be at peace with the facts and still work hard, even while you think it is futile. I simply think this is a possible state of mind that can be achieved by a normal human being. Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 2.259049892425537;;; So if it is possible, even in that circumstance, to be at peace and work hard to prevent the doom, it should be possible in any less dire circumstance.
local;;; 1.4576518535614014;;; Nothing about the futility of action seems to detract from the fun.

local;;; 1.9412260055541992;;; Do people not play these games?
Do people not try hard when playing these games?
No.

OpenAI;;; 2.065574884414673;;; To be fair, there is a big difference between this scenario and these games. In these games you can still make progress. And that is visible.
OpenAI;;; 3.0655109882354736;;; This is where I see death with dignity coming from. It's about setting our target to make as much progress as possible in getting a good outcome, instead of actually directly aiming to get a good outcome. If you would try to survive forever in Dawn of War 2, The Last Stand, it might be a lot more frustrating.
OpenAI;;; 1.369746208190918;;; You set out to a goal that you know is unachievable after all.

OpenAI;;; 2.6615607738494873;;; Maybe this is a fluke and I will feel different very soon. But today I felt like there was no problem with us being doomed. No problem in the sense of it would influence the things that I could do, in the sense that if I would work to prevent the doom, that negative qualia would arise that would steer me away from executing on a futile plan.
OpenAI;;; 2.2678539752960205;;; I didn't achieve this by pushing the doominess out of my mind. I was in this state while contemplating the doom.
local;;; 2.1992878913879395;;; I think to achieve this you need to stop wanting the doominess to go away.
Stop grasping onto that thread of hope that you have.

local;;; 2.8567140102386475;;; This might seem bleak, but from the first-person experience it is not at all.
Letting go of hopes and stopping to cleanse your mind when you think of doom doesn't actually
need to imply that you stop working on preventing the doom.

local;;; 1.1609060764312744;;; Rather, I think in this scenario it would do the opposite.

OpenAI;;; 2.603651762008667;;; There is no contradiction here. In my model, the consequentialist reasoning component of your mind is separate from all of these heuristic algorithms that compute feelings that arise in your consciousness, that have positive or negative values.
OpenAI;;; 2.1488759517669678;;; All of this reasoning so far applies to the situation where nothing what you do actually matters. I want to tell a little story about how I was wrong about this in the past.
OpenAI;;; 3.1827540397644043;;; New paragraph. Once upon a time, I played a round of 0k. I think it was my first ever match against another player. In the beginning it seemed like we were evenly matched, maybe I got the slight advantage. But then after some time it turned around, all my troops got decimated and I was pushed back into my base. I surely thought that I would lose, but I was not giving up in the face of that. I wanted to play, fight it out until the end.
OpenAI;;; 1.726973056793213;;; I definitely felt a pull towards just calling it GG and quitting. And I didn't batch in.
local;;; 1.9818971157073975;;; I had no more resources.
All I could do is construct lots of boxes of dirt.

local;;; 1.306859016418457;;; But still, I didn't give up.

local;;; 2.4179718494415283;;; I didn't not give up because I thought I would win, because I thought there is a good
chance that I could make a comeback.
It was simply raw, unfelt, maybe illogical determination to not give up.

local;;; 1.270298957824707;;; After some time defending my base using only bags of dirt.

local;;; 1.084425926208496;;; I managed to slightly push back the enemy.

local;;; 2.3309578895568848;;; However, it didn't took long and they reorganized an army and came back and again I thought
I would surely lose.
But still, I didn't give up.

OpenAI;;; 3.628804922103882;;; And then something unforeseen happened. My enemy got lazy or careless. I am not sure which, I am not sure what they were doing. Were they simply getting bored by my persistence? In any case, I had many dirt bags. And now I was starting to throw them at the enemy, slowly but surely pushing him back. And that push never really completely stopped. I was pushing forward more and more until I was in my enemy's base. And then it was only a matter of time until I would win.
OpenAI;;; 1.5536818504333496;;; by the fact that I was stretching out the game like an old chewing gum.
local;;; 1.3978750705718994;;; I believe there are states of mind like this that can be inhabited by humans.

OpenAI;;; 1.471977949142456;;; As far as I can tell.
OpenAI;;; 3.353637218475342;;; Well, I don't really think I have done a good job, open parenthesis or any job whatsoever, close parenthesis, on conveying how I achieved this. I think the fact that I can do this is probably related to meditation. For example in the Waking Up app Sam Harris sometimes gives explicit instructions to double quote give up the struggle double quote. And I think I just intuitively implied what I have learned there. So my best recommendation right now is to also learn it from there.
local;;; 1.836996078491211;;; Though probably it seems worth trying out.
Maybe people can just do this intuitively.

All the things that I have shown you before might have just been drafts.
Also I'm using Whisper right now to transcribe everything, which might be an

local;;; 1.3157689571380615;;; Interesting, I actually meant to say, tell me when you are available.

local;;; 1.9792640209197998;;; Double quote.
Once you are available, tell me.
Double quote.
Makes it even clearer.

OpenAI;;; 3.3623709678649902;;; No, I would prefer having ETAs. But, when you interpret tell me when you are available as you should tell me now when you are available then it sounds kind of harsh and direct. And I feel like this harsh and directness wouldn't be there if you interpret it as tell me once you are available. That doesn't sound harsh.
local;;; 1.826139211654663;;; And if it doesn't support three people, I could still just make it.
Do that.

OpenAI;;; 2.6712379455566406;;; Oh, totally. I'm just saying that I was saying something and the interpretation you made was different from the intended interpretation and using the interpretation you made, the statement I made sounded kind of harsh. So, I was sounding harsh without intending to. That's interesting. I sort of miscommunicated in some sense.
local;;; 1.0396311283111572;;; Yes, I'm ready.

OpenAI;;; 2.7305538654327393;;; I think I kind of remember now. The problem is that what if we have like we don't have the mechanism such that the system overall actually cares about what we want the system to care about.
OpenAI;;; 1.9165990352630615;;; Like, we don't know how to instill into the system. Like we don't have a training procedure such that after running the training procedure, the system wants the thing that we wanted the system to want.
OpenAI;;; 3.7614352703094482;;; Hmm. Hmm. Well, I'm not sure that this makes sense to apply this to the current systems, because they're sort of not self-aware enough in some sense, I would guess. Like, yes, I think this is an example, but it's not the kind of example that is, like, the dangerous thing. Like, and it's also not entirely clear what's going on here. Okay.
OpenAI;;; 3.1093051433563232;;; the abstract definition of what? We don't know how Assume we would know what we want and we would know how to formally specify that even what we want. We have some sort of mathematical definition of the thing we want Now we don't know how to construct in a current machine learning paradigm We don't know how to like have a training procedure such that the system that results from that training procedure Wants The Actual like formal specification that doesn't want to satisfy that doesn't want to optimize for it Like you don't know how to do that that it wants that
OpenAI;;; 4.239441871643066;;; Um, Hmm. Yeah, but, like, the problem here is also that it's not that open. I mean, I know what it even means to be woke or something. It's literally just this RLHF. You know, it's like a lot.
OpenAI;;; 4.015465974807739;;; Yes, they... but like, yes, like assume they had like, they had a really good idea of what like they want the system to do. Even in like, because here maybe the problem is they don't even know what they what they would want the system to do. Because they just use RLHF which is like a human, it's like, hmm, that's the slut cock. Yes, exactly. Yes the point is that we don't know how to, like we don't know a procedure that if you use this procedure to like create a system, we don't know that if this procedure has, like we don't know a procedure where you give in like sort of this like, oh we want the system to do this, or want this, and then the procedure creates a system, we don't know, we don't know this procedure that then creates a system that actually wants the thing that we set it should want.
OpenAI;;; 6.203702926635742;;; Yeah. Yeah. Though, yeah. Like, it becomes a lot worse once the system actually becomes AGI and, like, cares about something. Yeah. I mean, even OpenAI says that it's a problem and they don't know how to align more powerful systems, and therefore they want to make the current systems do a lot of research. I mean, the problem is, how capable need the system to be in order to actually, like, do successful alignment research? And do they maybe need to be so capable that they can already sort of deceive us into, like, building things that look aligned but are actually not? But as I was trying to illustrate... No, but I was giving the... I mean, I was not talking about manoeuvrance at any point. Like, my argument is not AI is gonna be manoeuvrant and gonna hate us and therefore will kill us. This is not my argument. If you think at any point this is my argument or have thought that this was not my argument.
local;;; 1.8648419380187988;;; What did I actually say that makes you think that?
Well, here's what I...

OpenAI;;; 5.832343101501465;;; I see, yeah. Maybe this is like... Maybe they are so capable that they output plans that deceive us. Like, you know, you could like output plans that deceive us without having any sort of... without like... Exactly. Yes, exactly. New paragraph. So... But I'm saying... Like the thing what I was saying earlier with the tree search. You can have a tree search such that... The tree search searches over reality and then figures out an action that maximizes some internal goal that it has. And like in the tree search, a tree search doesn't really... It's like you wouldn't describe a tree search as having like a theory of mind, right? It just searches over trajectories of like... And like to determine like what action is like the best. But this kind of search can output an action that sort of deceives you in the sense that like... Like for example, the tree search might output like, oh, I should output like this sort of like plan for building an AGI that will look aligned to the human but by some weird mechanism in the AI that's not obvious to the human at all and the human is not gonna figure out, will make the AI such that it will optimize for the thing that I'm caring about.
OpenAI;;; 1.978308916091919;;; Maybe you could write it down. Alright. That. Why? What? Right, I can just like repeat what I was saying exactly word by word.
OpenAI;;; 6.209544897079468;;; Well, you were saying like deception. It's like, oh, deception. I don't buy this. Like, this sounds malevolent. But I'm saying the tree search. And also if you have a tree search, it could output actions that deceive you, like in the way I described, which I didn't get to yet. But like it could output. Yes, and the thing is, the tree search wouldn't be described as deceiving you, right? It's just a tree search. It's just like a search process. It doesn't model you. It doesn't, it doesn't model. Yes, in some sense, but like it's not deceiving in the, oh, the tree search is evil or something like that. It's malevolent. It's trying to kill us. It's trying to kill us. Malevolent. Malevolent. Well, that's what I'm saying. It doesn't have a gender. Yes, that's, yes, that's exactly right. It's like, could be like a slightly random deviation from the goal that the human wanted to put in and a slight deviation from like the complicated human value would probably, if you apply really hard optimization pressure, result in something that the humans wouldn't approve of at all. That's a problem.
OpenAI;;; 3.892064094543457;;; Yeah, the point is that we don't know how to make the system sort of care exactly about what we want and slight deviations from that will probably, if you apply really hard optimization pressure be horrible. Yeah, I mean, yes, like, you don't have to think to construct a system to actually want what we want, but maybe something that's like some proxy, like something that's like looks probably like what we want on the training distribution, but then like breaks once you go far enough of distribution, which is like, it's gonna happen. Wait, I didn't quite get that. So yes, maybe I should wait until I see that.
local;;; 3.5567281246185303;;; I got to repeat that.
I shouldn't sit in this room that is completely air isolated and really sticky.
I already moved.
Yes.
Yes.

OpenAI;;; 7.994946002960205;;; So this would be about that we don't know how to get the we don't have the actual thing we care about that we would want to put into the system, is that about this? All right. All right, let's yeah, you gave this example of the technology. So like, let's think. Okay, maybe an example here would be like, let's assume we put the the best philosophy into the AI that we had like in ancient Greece, or something like that. And then we would invent like technology for like uploading humans into a computer and then being able to self modify. Yeah, yeah, about like, let's say like, abortions and birth control. Like maybe this would be they would like, like the the the act. So let me try to say this. The so like, the ancient Greek philosophers would have a way to articulate in language, what they care about. And they, they could articulate like the things they care about. And if we would take this explicit articulation, and then bring it forth into the 21st century, and then we would look at the stuff that's here. By the 22nd, 21st century, and then it was like, then, then, then like, it would tell us something about the thing, maybe it will tell us, oh, wait, this is like, not something that this talks about at all. But the thing is, if we would bring forth the philosophers, and would make them understand everything about the modern world, they would develop an intuition that was like, there is like, the human brain has a mechanism that sort of like, caches out the value sort of, or like the evaluation of like, the value and what you should think about the situation as like a process, like unfolding the value based on like the new situations. And this process was not transmitted in the explicit thing that the philosophers could say, when they were in ancient Greece, and were thinking about their current world. And the similar thing could happen here, that's what you're pointing at.
OpenAI;;; 17.505478143692017;;; Yeah, so this would be about, they have sort of implicit, like, there are some implicit assumptions in their model of like, how much sex to have, that would be, that they don't think about consciously. And that would be invalidated. Yes, and they're like in the background, not think, think about explicitly, not thinking about as, as a thing like, oh, this could break and then like my model would change. Yes. That's a problem, yes. Yeah. Okay. randomly. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, so interpretability is about how do we get the right, how do we get the thing into the system. I think, are you sure you're using the words? Okay, I guess it doesn't matter. Change the matrix values directly to, yeah. Oh, that's totally possible. I mean, why would that not be possible? I mean, might be very hard, but like, I think in principle, why would that not be possible? I would be very surprised if the answer is no. I think the relevant question is more like, can we do this well enough before the AGI kills us? Yeah. Yeah, that's like step one. Then there's step two. What do you mean with more direct methods of training? Oh, yeah, there's a post by John Wentworth. He describes, well, he has like one hypothesis, which is like, maybe the AI learns natural abstractions and humans' values, like, natural abstractions, like, if you have an arbitrary agent, like, they will all discover mathematics, and they will all discover, like, the laws of physics, and they will all, like, they will all model, have a concept of iron ore and steel or something, like, all of the, like, useful concepts that are, like, just, like, really useful for, like, doing anything, or, like, doing material science. And then also, like, and the thing is like, oh, maybe also one of these things the systems would learn is, like, human values. It's just a natural thing that they would learn, like, not necessarily for, for wanting to care about them, but just in the process of, oh, modeling humans, humans around, modeling them is useful, and part of that model, the AI has, creates, like, also a model of the human values. And then if he puts no interpretability, like, if he had good enough interpretability tools, we could look at the system, look where is this, where is, like, the reasoning engine of the system, that's, like, the general, like, optimizing thing, and where are the values of the humans, and then sort of point the consequential reasoning thing at the human values as the goal. Or, like, I mean, ideally, it would be, like, I mean. No, I mean, yeah, I think the strong version of the natural abstraction hypothesis is false. Not all Asians will actually develop the exact same concepts. If there's, like, yes, that's also not what I was saying, but, like, like, in the version that I was describing, it's not, like, this AGI that you might have might not have concept of dogs or something. They might just have, like, concept of small furry animal or something, or, like, and it's, like, doesn't actually care about to differentiate them, or, like, maybe doesn't have any concept about that at all. And still might have, like, concept of human values, like, if, if, like, human values seem more, more, for some AI, like, like, there is some AI that wouldn't learn human values, like, like, if you have an AGI where, like, it's already, like, in a position where it's, like, oh, I can do whatever I want, and you start there, like, then it probably has no incentive to learn human values. It's, like, I mean, do we, yeah, and, and humans, except a few humans, don't try really hard to understand what are the values of ants.
OpenAI;;; 9.220062017440796;;; Well, I am actually not sure. One thing that I have been thinking about is like, hmm, if we construct an artificial scientist, sort of we can circumvent needing to do interpretability research. If we can con... So one thing that seems very useful for advanced AI systems is to build models of the world and update them as you observe new information. It just seems like any AGI will probably be able to do something like that. And it seems like doing that kind of process is possibly most of what an AGI needs to do. Like building some sort of reasoning engine on top of like a really good world model that uses the world model in order to determine what actions the agent should perform such that it maximizes some objective is probably a lot easier, I think. Now, new paragraph. If we could figure out how to write down an explicit algorithm for doing this sort of world building, world model building thing, then I think it would probably... Like then we had like a really big chunk of like what the AGI is like needing to do in a form that is sort of not necessarily super easy to interpret, but like it's like a lot easier to analyze. Like imagine we have just like normal source code where it's like, oh yeah, to like build a good model of the world, first we need to like do this step of like, oh yeah, we process the visual input stream and segment it into objects. And then like, oh, then we do this, then we like take this object and like infer some sort of attributes from it. And then we compare it in some space to like other objects that we already have like, like that they already have discovered in the world that we have like made into like concept clusters. And then we compare it and let's look at if we already have a concept that is similar to this. And stuff like that, that is like, oh yeah, this part of the code does this and this part of the code does this. And like this would not be like really aligned, but like first of all, like maybe the system you could build in such a way that like, first of all, like you might be able to build it such that like, if you have explicitly laid out the step by step reasoning of like how to build a good world model, then it seems like figuring out how to change this algorithm such that you make the system do what you want would be a lot easier. Like because like you could make the system probably change it such that it actually cares only about building a good model of the world, like in a myopic way where it doesn't care about the future or something like doing that sort of thing and figuring out how to do that is probably a lot easier if you have the concrete world modeling system that is already transparent. In the sense that it's like chunks of code blocks.
OpenAI;;; 6.594196081161499;;; Well, what I'm saying is that a lot about what intelligence even is, seems to be about how do I even create good world models. So that might be the hardest part of the problem. And it seems like if we would solve this problem and had this good solution for how to build world models, then, I mean, if we build any sort of AGI system, then we could first of all just put that transparent part in, right? It's like, oh, we need to make a model of the world. New paragraph. What exactly do you mean with that? So I mean, I'm imagining a process that you have like the line by line source code of like what's going on in the system. And like if you don't understand this, and the world modeling part, but like the world modeling part is the thing that creates the world models, right? It's like maybe you build other systems on top of that, but the world modeling thing is going to be that thing. Maybe if a different system and the other system is like, oh yeah, that's the world model thing, but like I'm just going to completely ignore it and build my own world model. Sure, maybe that might be a concern. But like, like ideally you would, ideally you would have, yeah, but ideally, I mean, you would want to have the other system, like if that is the hardest part of the problem, and I'm right about that, then building the other systems would be easy in comparison to building the world modeling engine. Like building the, well, it could use NNs in parts, in places where we would know that it couldn't do anything deceptive. For example, if you need to do object segmentation from a camera feed, can probably use some CNNs to do this without the system being under light, because you just have some like pretty small CNNs that are like not doing any high level reasoning or anything. Yeah.
OpenAI;;; 6.500204801559448;;; Yeah, that is, that is one approach. The thing is that I don't actually know how would you align a system if you, like, assume you have this word modeling engine. And just like, makes good word models. Now, what do you do next? How do you do pivot and act? Like this, like, I would expect if you would have the word modeling engine, that would become clearer. But I don't know, it seems like we're thinking about more, how would you use this whole? The problem is, if you just have the word modeling thing, and you don't have the entire system as a whole that can now, like, optimize for stuff, and you have it laid out in such a way that it's actually understandable, then somebody can still take the word modeling thing that's really capable now and strap around it to neural network that does, like, using the word model, does some sort of task thing. But then you still have all of the problems that, okay, now you made, like, the black box neural networks more capable by giving them access to this word model, but you actually, like, didn't align the black box neural networks. Like this wouldn't, like, no, not if you, like, actually figure out the entire system such that you can deploy it, and it's aligned, and, like, prevents everybody else from building an underlined AGI. I need to go to the toilet. I'll be back in, I don't know, up to ten minutes.
OpenAI;;; 18.955765962600708;;; All right, what was the thing I wanted to talk about? Oh, it would be so convenient if text-to-speech had worked before, because then I would know it now exactly by just reading what I said before. What did I say? So, we talked about different things. What are the things that people should do? Oh, I remember now everything. New paragraph. So when I talk about the stuff about what you should do, I have an implicit model in my mind. Imagine you have a forest of trees, you know, trees like, well, like a forest is a list of trees, right? So like, imagine you have a forest, but you know, if I just say I have a forest, then like what? You have a forest? Anyway, new paragraph. Yes, I'm talking about the forest data structure, which is a list of trees. Now yes, let's say it's a set of trees. Now yes, we have trees in a collection. Yes, and each tree has as the root node a pivotal act, meaning some sort of game-changing winning action that we do. Now each of the trees represents sort of like a tech tree of the different components that we need in order to perform the pivotal act. And these components in turn, they can have also dependencies, right? Like, oh, to understand. Yeah, exactly. I mean, yeah. I feel like it's a tree because there's this one root node, right? The deck doesn't have like, this is the root node. Yeah, sure. Oh, so this is actually not a tree. It's actually a deck. Yeah, that makes sense. And they also like, like they don't, like in a tree you have like layers. But like, but you could have like one node that is. No, you can't, in the way that I'm thinking about it. Imagine you have a tree, you have a node in layer one, and then you have a node in layer two, and then you have a node in layer three. And the node in layer three is like a child of layer two and layer one. And layer one is a child of layer, layer two is a child of layer one also. Like then it's like, like, what? Like there's no layer, right? There's like no way to like separate it. Like the three nodes in like different layers is like kind of weird. It's like, you have like, you have like connections between these layers. And it's like, there's no way to arrange them such that they wouldn't be. Oh yeah, sure, there's some procedure to arrange them into layers. I was, guess I was thinking about layers in the sense that there wouldn't be connections through a layer. Like none of it. I see. So it is like all dependencies for layer three are met once you're in layer four. Yeah. I was thinking about it below, because I was still thinking about the tree. Or a root system, which would be a better name perhaps. Yeah, because the tree is actually like the roots of the tree and not the crown. That's what we, the following way around if it was the crown. I know it's, it's just. New paragraph. So the idea is that you have this forest and we have all of the dependencies and we have like different pivotal acts. Like it's not, like there could be two trees with the same kind of pivotal act and like, they're like slightly different ways to achieve it. Like the tree looks, or like the deck looks different. Oh yeah, it's not a forest. It's like a deck collection, collection of decks that are topologically sorted. All right. Yes. With like sub decks. No. Or how do you say it? I don't know. Okay. We have one deck that is like, I think we understand what we are talking about. So let's not needlessly try to specify it more. So and like this is sort of the structure that I have in mind. And I think before we were talking about what do you decide to work on or something like that. And like, and then I was saying like, oh, you know, you have interpretability and interpretability is probably one of these components that shows up in lots of these decks. But there will be decks that don't have this. And there will be, and in no deck there will probably only be interpretability and this is like the only requirement of things you need to figure out. There will be lots of other hard problems you need to figure out in order to be able to get to the perfect act. I mean, at the very least you need to like use your interpretability to understand the systems. Yeah, it's like, yeah, I mean, you can do it really. Like yeah, I didn't specify how precise you need to be, kind of on purpose, because it seems useful to like have these decks at different levels of granularity. Like it's used to have like a high level deck that's like interpretability is just one note, let's say. But in another deck it's like, you know, interpretability is like lots of different notes actually. You could like expand it. But more like you have a deck in a note or something. And you could expand it, then it's larger.
OpenAI;;; 17.164451837539673;;; Well, the point was sort of like, this is just a useful sort of framing to think about to get clearer about what's the best thing to do, to visualize it. It just tells you about, oh, now you can go like, oh, okay, what are the other notes that we need to figure out? If we figure out interpretability, what are the other things that are still missing? And how does it all sum up to being able to do a pivotal act? This is just a supernatural question to ask, right? If you're having this picture in your head. Yeah, it's a very natural question to ask, I think, because like, a very natural question to ask. And also it makes it clear that there are many paths towards succeeding in principle, and many ways that you could. New paragraph. So the problem is that, yes, there is a difference between, I think this distinction makes sense between practical and theoretical considerations. But this graph structure that I was saying is, like, one thing that you might be missing out there is calculating what's the time that it takes to finish the thing. Like when I'm saying these are hypothetically possible things you could do, it doesn't mean that we have the time to do them. Yes, and like, considerations about can we coordinate these people to behave in this way? Because there's one thing which is literally pivotal, like, get everybody to agree in sort of a credible way that actually, like, we know, yes, they actually agree to stop all AGI development until we get to understand the alignment to such that, like, everybody agrees that now we understand how to do it. Yes, but like, this is like an unrealistic version of like some ideal thing we could achieve. Like, and the constraint there is not necessarily time or else it's kind of sort of an accurate, but it's like coordination ability and like, and ability to explain the technical problems to people such that they would understand them. Yeah, and I'm making the point that there are lots of different like constraints in practice that are like, like, it's very different constraint like having just not enough time to do some research to getting political party to agree to do something to not having your AGI researchers run off with your AGI code because you can't like credibly find people that are actually aligned in a reliable way. Like, these are like very different kinds of practical problems. New paragraph. Yes, this is actually a pretty important problem that nobody really knows how to solve and it's not clear that the solution exists. Maybe this is just another really hard thing that would be really good if we could get it. I mean, Eliezer, Eliezer said to me once that if he could know, if he would know how to get 50 AI researchers that were all aligned, then he would like do this artificial scientist thing. But he wouldn't do it because he worries that he can't find that many people such that there wouldn't be somebody who runs off with his R-Squad and then deploys it on their own. I don't know how to do it either. Oh, oh wait. I mean, I agree that there are more than 50 people that would not destroy the world if you give them the AGI code. But how do you find them? And how do you have a procedure for selecting for them rather than the ones that would destroy the world? Like, that is the problem, you know. It's not like a non-existence problem, it's a problem of finding these people, select and selecting them. But yes, and like, do you think this is an easy problem? That's like, I mean, I feel like, I also feel like Eliezer shouldn't give up on that. Like, it seems maybe he gave up too quickly, I'm not sure. But like, it seems like that is like an easier problem than like, make China and every other major government that could play a role agree to like, not develop AGI. But it doesn't seem like an easy problem. It's like, oh yeah, obviously, it's the solution. Just so that and then you filter. I mean, I know. If I would know the AGI code, I think the only two people, okay, there are like only three people I would be comfortable sharing it with, I think. The problem was, I think, probably also about that you want to have engineers. Like, you need to have 50 engineers. Like, that was what he was talking about. And like, engineers are like, like now you're selecting from an even smaller subset of like, oh yeah, you need to have these technical skills and need to be aligned. I don't understand what you mean alignment would change. Sure, but this kind of test you don't have. Yeah, this is a good point. Like, even if you had this test and it said no, and it's like it doesn't actually tell you no, yes.

OpenAI;;; 3.792250156402588;;; Yes, I think I understand this. The method that I am describing is not about increasing dignity. Rather, I am trying to point out that there is a particular state of mind, I think, in which even if nothing that you would do matter, you could still work on something. I of course completely agree that you should still work on the thing that is most likely to have a counterfactual impact. New paragraph. Another strategy I like to do is to think about the world where we survive, and then try to understand what thoughts of things I would have been doing in that world when what I have been doing has contributed to avoiding doom.
local;;; 3.8043668270111084;;; But I like to give the extreme example of that there is nothing that you can do, and
then you can still work, because if this sort of state of mind exists, then for any less
dire circumstance where you can actually make an impact, you should be able to also be at
peace in that situation, where I think it is often more useful to be at peace than to
continually panic.

OpenAI;;; 3.817457914352417;;; I might have not explained this well, but this technique is not about forgetting the Dhooma at all, it's just about disconnecting yourself from it emotionally. You can stop grasping the hope and be at peace with the imminent Dhoom, but then still think about how to prevent the Dhoom. That is the state of mind I'm trying to point at here. The consequentialist reasoning that you do in order to optimize away the Dhoom does not need to be fueled by emotions of aversion and clinging.
OpenAI;;; 3.0794677734375;;; In fact, I have found it counterproductive to experience these emotions. That is why I am suggesting this strategy, though maybe I haven't explained it properly in this post. But again, it's definitely not about forgetting the doom.

OpenAI;;; 2.417948007583618;;; I agree, this post is good and the comment is also good. Though, they all seem to be at least in part about how to feel better in the face of doom.

reasoning process.

local;;; 9.700868129730225;;; I think this is a good technique to use in order to quickly reason through something.
However, it seems like some people really do not like this technique
and they are annoyed that you are saying so many things that are obvious or that are wrong
and you would notice that they are wrong after thinking about only a few seconds.
New paragraph.
Just think about all of the people who give the advice of
you should think before you say something.
Basically what I am saying is the opposite right here.
You should not think before you say something.
You should immediately try to squeeze all of your thoughts into language by saying them out loud.
Because this process of squeezing your thoughts into language forces you to make them more precise
and makes you notice all of these flaws.
New paragraph.
It is because that you are forcing all of these thoughts into language
that you notice all of the flaws in the first place.
If you wouldn't do this, it would take more effort and time to even notice all the things that are wrong with it.
So each time that you force what you think into language and you say something wrong,
in some sense this is success.
Because you have probably just noticed how you are wrong faster than if you had not forced it into language.

local;;; 11.785309791564941;;; To me it seems clear that a superhuman can be better at predicting what tokens comes

New paragraph.
For example, consider that humans do not actually understand psychosis.
They don't have the concept of psychosis.
On the internet there are some people who are psychotic who write.
Now a human that doesn't have the concept of psychosis might not be able to pick up
on all of the clues that a person with psychosis would give in their writing, that they are
in this category of psychotic people.
Now if being psychotic actually influences what you write, then knowing that this person
is psychotic and the previous text was written by a psychotic person is useful for predicting
the text that will follow.
New paragraph.
Therefore a superhuman who would have this concept of psychosis could be better at predicting
the text.
New paragraph.
Now psychosis is just a random example, but I would be surprised if there are not a lot
of attributes that a human can have that show up and influence their writing.
And a human probably doesn't understand all of these attributes and can infer them from
text.
You can become better at doing this kind of thing than a human.
However as you become better than a human at predicting the text, you will actually
increase performance.
I.e. it is possible to become better at predicting the text compared to a human.

Yeah, I'm using OpenAI API because I don't want... I want the biggest model, I want the large V2 model and not like the tiny model that I can run on this. But I have a different laptop where I set up a server that actually has a 16 gigabyte GPU so I can run it there. But it's kind of inconvenient because it doesn't have a public IP address and it doesn't run right now, for example. So it's very convenient to use the OpenAI API. But then you need to pay. Yes, but it only costs 0.006 cents per minute to transcribe. That's not bad. Or something like that. Maybe there's even one more zero, I'm not sure. Maybe that was the chat for our chat GPT. You just spent that amount of money on me, basically. I mean, this is such a tiny amount of money. I'm glad, man. I feel like... I think I've... It's a step in the right direction, man.

OpenAI;;; 12.103299140930176;;; having humans around to be the optimal thing once you start to optimize hard for that objective function.
OpenAI;;; 3.8973519802093506;;; Most objectives that you could build into an AI will not care about humans at all and therefore will set various parameters to extreme values that will kill humans even in the case where an AI wouldn't optimize for killing humans directly. One dumb example would be that for the AI it might be okay to not care at all about the environment so it scales up industrial processes polluting the air so much that humans just can't survive anymore. Of course in practice an AI would want to optimize for eradicating all humans or at least disempowering them so much that they definitely can't stop the AI anymore.
OpenAI;;; 9.344093799591064;;; Simply killing all humans seems strictly easier than doing some elaborate plan that preserves some of them.

OpenAI;;; 2.675800085067749;;; We kind of joined the server on a whim.
OpenAI;;; 10.01024603843689;;; So I was just saying if you have like 10 modules and they're all designed by a different AI because if you have one AI designing the whole system, you can come up with some very nasty tricks to somehow get round it. But maybe if each one's designed by a different AI, it reduces the scope for funny business. Well, you're assuming each module is designed by an AI, but that seems like not caught to what I'm saying. It seems like what I'm saying is like you want to have the modules and that they are interpretable and there are multiple ways to get them. And one would be to have like an AI design them or one would be like to extract algorithms from neural networks or one would be just to algorithmic design. Okay, so if you are designing any of them by AI, I wouldn't want the same AI to be generating multiple modules. I would want to have different AI's design different modules. Even if it's just like slightly retrained versions of the original. I mean, maybe there are some weird problems there. Maybe some of these AI's can do some kind of weird acausal cooperation. But it just feels like, you know, you're giving the AI, each AI has more limited power. It can only design one of the modules and that limits their ability to set up a very complicated interaction effect that somehow achieves some kind of goal, which you don't catch because it can only design one module and it doesn't necessarily have all of the details about the other modules and they can make it harder. So, corrigibility stuff, that's a taskishness. Have you read, have you ever read, or not quite a taskishness. It's one of the things. Have you read Leeser's post on corrigibility? Maybe I've read some things he said about it at some point. It's in a Glowfic actually, it's hard to find. Someone posted it on Lesserot. Someone posted it on Lesserot? Okay. If you have the link, that would be great if you could go on the chat or something at some point. Okay, thanks. I don't know if I have very many other thoughts on this kind of topic. So, yeah, you've got Whisper. Any use in Whisper? These ASIP transcriber stuff? I have made the program that now I was recording.
OpenAI;;; 7.504877090454102;;; So you made the program yourself or you taught it? Yeah, I mean if you have a key to the transcription, if you have a key to the OpenAI API then... Basically I just have a thing, I call it OpenAI API, but I have like the Python code such that I can do a keyboard shortcut. Nice. How long did it take you to make that one? Too long, like, I don't know, 10 hours. Okay, yeah. That's pretty cool. I just worked on it just before I came down because I added some nice improvements like don't delete instantly the audio file such that if there's an error you then lose everything. Oh, damn, yeah. Yeah, but now that is not a problem anymore. Okay, that's pretty cool. Do you have code for it, like published or did you just give that to yourself? Yeah, I just gave it to him. Okay, and he said you could post a link to... Yeah, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah. You need to install some Python libraries and... Fair enough. Yeah, I've got a bunch of Python coding, so yeah.

OpenAI;;; 3.6641080379486084;;; what has been built. The understanding is a tool you have along the way while building to know your thing does what you intend.
OpenAI;;; 5.508440017700195;;; To me it seems that building AGI will be the most impactful thing that humans will ever do. It will shape the future of the universe. I care about AI alignment because even though I'm somewhat confused about what I want, I think it is something like optimize for as many positive experiences and minimize the amount of negative experiences that exist in the universe. It will exist.
OpenAI;;; 2.7992141246795654;;; The best approximation that I expect to be roughly right is that I want there to be as many positive experiences and as few negative experiences in the universe as possible.
OpenAI;;; 3.3456172943115234;;; I think current systems are problematic, because we do not understand the internal workings. We use SGD in order to endow some parameterized computational structure with the right parameters, such that the computations performed overall correspond to computations we want.
OpenAI;;; 3.079970121383667;;; A central difficulty with this approach is that it makes it very hard for us to differentiate between a model doing something because it terminally values doing that thing, or because it doesn't want us to modify itself anymore.
OpenAI;;; 3.6005470752716064;;; One thing I have been thinking about is how we might be able to understand future AGI systems. I think by thinking about what sorts of algorithms we expect to be generally useful for any advanced agent, we can... ...get at certain capabilities.
OpenAI;;; 1.9018003940582275;;; Future AIs we build right now.
OpenAI;;; 3.2576358318328857;;; One approach here is to think about what algorithms are just generally so useful that no AGI could do without. The central example here is building and updating a model of the world. Every agent that wants to operate in the complex and messy thing that is the real world will need to have some solid procedures for doing this. New paragraph. This means that by understanding better how to create such world models we could...
OpenAI;;; 3.8886771202087402;;; This could be helpful for understanding future HEI systems in several ways. New numbered bullet If we would understand the world modeling algorithm, we could use it as the base of an HEI system that we will build. If we manage to understand the world modeling algorithm well and make it interpretable, this means that the system overall will be more interpretable, even if we would use some black box optimization procedures for other parts of the system. Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 4.186950922012329;;; new numbered bullet. Use this understanding in order to figure out where a word model is in the current machine learning paradigm i.e. neural networks. I expect that the initial word model algorithm we might find looks very different from what a neural network optimized with SGD might find. However, I expect that finding other implementations of the word modeling algorithm will probably become easier. So we might be able to much easier figure out what kinds of word modeling algorithm a neural network would find and how to detect it.
OpenAI;;; 6.748121023178101;;; We could use this as one modular component in an AGI that we might build that is a complete white box. I think probably there exists a Python program that implements an AGI such that the Python program doesn't use any procedures for finding decision algorithms. The program just lays out the entire decision algorithm on its own. For example, SGD is an algorithm that searches over parameters for a neural network and selects neural networks that perform well on a given loss function. I'm thinking about the scenario that we built in AGI, but instead of having an algorithm that figures out what computations would correspond to good performance, we just write the algorithm that would give us good performance by hand such that it will be in an interpretable form that is easy for humans to analyze. I expect in this scenario, where we have an AGI algorithm laid out bare in front of us, it will be a lot easier to analyze what changes we would need to make to these algorithms in order to make it aligned, and what problems still remain.
OpenAI;;; 3.8576550483703613;;; Of course, ideally, while you do the algorithmic design, you steer your design towards being alignable in the first place. As much as possible.
OpenAI;;; 5.41579794883728;;; I have also been thinking about how we might use visualization tools in order to better interpret our current systems. For example, check out the following video, which is about a binary visualization tool that works with arbitrary binary input data in order to visualize certain structures in the data such that by looking at the visualization you can identify what kind of data you are looking at. If we could do something similar with algorithms in neural networks, this might be beneficial. For example, could we create a visualization such that from the visualization you could see if certain things are going on inside the neural network? Is the neural network building a theory of mind? Is it running some computation that is correlated with thinking about how to do deception? Could you see what parts of the neural network execute an algorithm that could be described as doing some search?
OpenAI;;; 4.425756931304932;;; Another thing I thought about is how we might go about encoding formally various intuitive concepts that we as humans have about agency. For example, I might describe another human as wanting something, or as caring about another human, or as trying to do something. There are many more examples like this. All of these point at some behavior that we can observe in humans and other animals. The fact of the matter is though, that all of these behaviors are caused by various computations performed by the human brain.
OpenAI;;; 5.006464958190918;;; So therefore, it seems like all of these human intuitions talk about properties of computational processes. So the idea is to generalize these intuitions to computational processes in general, at such a level of detail that you understand mechanistically what it would mean for a particular computation that is running to want something. I don't expect that these intuitive human concepts translate one-to-one into a true name. However, I think they are useful starting points that we can use to guide our research into directions where we are still currently confused about agency.

OpenAI;;; 1.3168859481811523;;; The idea is...
OpenAI;;; 4.693453073501587;;; It seems like the main difficulty in AI alignment is that we are going to build it and we are not going to stop it. This also means that if we could achieve something like global cooperation around the issue of not getting into an arms race and being very careful with how we develop the capabilities of our models, most of the problem of alignment would go away. I expect in that case we would just have a lot more time to study what is going on, such that we could come to a deep understanding of fundamental issues related to agency and other theoretical considerations that are relevant for understanding how to build a system that actually wants what we want it to want.
OpenAI;;; 4.454285144805908;;; In order to develop really powerful, optimizing systems that transform the world in the way we approve, we need to deeply understand the inner workings of these systems. This could either be achieved by building a system from scratch that just uses interpretable methods, or by using a system that is built on a single algorithm. As an example, consider how interpretable a quick sort list sorting algorithm is. You can look at the algorithm and understand each step that the algorithm performs. That means it is a lot easier to reason about the algorithm and how various properties
OpenAI;;; 1.5296766757965088;;; how to make it aligned.
OpenAI;;; 5.370407819747925;;; Sadly, the state-of-the-art systems do not have the property of being easy to interpret to humans. It's very hard to do any kind of analysis on these systems when we do not understand the internal workings. I think interpretability could be useful in various ways. The first most obvious one is that if we could look inside a system and understand all of the internal parts, we would probably have a much easier time to analyze alignment-relevant properties of these systems. Also, we might have an easier time to see how a system might break in a particular way and how to fix that breakage. Another way interpretability could be useful is by looking at and understanding the internal mechanisms of a model and then extracting out these mechanisms, i.e. doing algorithmic discovery by understanding and extracting algorithms from neural networks. These extracted algorithms could then be put into a form that is easy to interpret for humans and...
OpenAI;;; 1.8442318439483643;;; This would make then again the analysis of the algorithms easier.
OpenAI;;; 3.2427830696105957;;; The author is concerned that if somebody well-intentioned expects that somebody else is developing AI in such a way that the chance of their AI being misaligned is greater than if the author's party forward slash entity
OpenAI;;; 1.7110569477081299;;; We have two parties A and B.
OpenAI;;; 3.0258750915527344;;; They would do so because they think that party B has a higher chance of building a better system. Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 3.4454448223114014;;; Party A might do so, because they think Party B is more advanced at AI technologies and they estimate that there is a chance that Party B will deploy transformative AI first. Which means something like being able to do whatever you want.
OpenAI;;; 2.822453022003174;;; The author worries about the possibility that you mistakenly...
OpenAI;;; 3.4470248222351074;;; The intelligence information of Party A doesn't map to reality. In that case, Party A would just have accelerated AI timelines, leaving less time to solve AI alignment related issues and therefore increasing existential risk.
OpenAI;;; 3.8435299396514893;;; I do think this is a valid concern. Right now, there seem to be various fundamental issues with regards to how to build an aligned agent that we have not figured out yet. Observing these theoretical considerations is a complex process that takes time. Therefore, the less time we have by accelerating AI capabilities, as we would need to do if we race towards transformative AI.
OpenAI;;; 1.6192901134490967;;; the less likely it is that we will resolve all of the technical hurdles in time.
OpenAI;;; 7.0345458984375;;; Failing to jump over these technical hurdles likely means that we will build an agentic system that doesn't want what we want, therefore leading to the destruction of the universe.
OpenAI;;; 1.9757399559020996;;; I think there is a more general form of the problem the author is concerned about that we should take into account.
OpenAI;;; 1.795107126235962;;; To engage in a race dynamic, it is simply necessary that
OpenAI;;; 1.9281589984893799;;; Somebody who is thinking about these problems, I expect to also take into account the probability of the party B developing a misaligned AI versus an aligned AI.
OpenAI;;; 4.08171820640564;;; Furthermore, it seems worth considering that if you engage in such a race dynamic, you might actually prompt the other party to do likewise. If you are initially mistaken about the capabilities of party B and then accelerate your own research, party B might notice that and accelerate their own research in turn. This would happen if party B would get the relevant intelligence, regardless of how far they were ahead over party A in the beginning, at least as long as they would see a chance that they could go first.
OpenAI;;; 3.838176965713501;;; There is one factor that the author is missing. Depending on how easy it is to create the blackball technology, even a global government might not suffice. For example, if you could create a nuclear blast by microwaving sand, we would probably all already be dead. Or at the very least, the world would be devastated.
OpenAI;;; 4.329922914505005;;; The author says that if you have a really powerful, destructive technology, then you are automatically incentivized to attack all other factions and wipe out any resistance before they come to be able to wield this power too. I.e. if you get a strategic advantage, you are incentivized to exploit it in order to gain total control and prevent other parties from gaining the power you gained. In other words, you want to act in the window of opportunity where you are powerful and nobody else can match or resist your power. The author then argues that this problem would not exist if we had a global government. With a global government, you could create oversight institutions that would enforce a ban on any technology that would enable you to gain a strategic advantage in this way.
OpenAI;;; 5.0697181224823;;; This example isn't actually that far off. Imagine artificial intelligence. It seems quite likely that there are algorithms that anybody that owns a computer, i.e. everybody, could run and destroy the world with. This would probably not work in the current machine learning paradigm where we have huge and costly training routes. However, there's probably much simpler algorithms that are much less data hungry that would also destroy the world. Consider how much fewer examples a human child needs in order to learn something. And there is no reason to suppose that human children learning is the optimal that can be achieved in learning in general. There is probably an algorithm that you can run with a couple of hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of normal, off-the-shelf hardware.
OpenAI;;; 7.557009935379028;;; If you have a powerful actor, then they are not incentivized to use the new gained technological power destructively. If we have any actor that is very powerful, then that means that they must have been very intelligent in order to be able to gain access to the technology in the first place. As we can see, humans are the most advanced moral species on the planet. We care for other animals. This is behavior that we don't really see in other animals at all. It seems that this is probably related to humans being more intelligent than other animals. This way we can reflect and consider what other animals experience and how we would feel about experiencing these things ourselves. Any actor that would gain extremely destructive technologies would also need to be very smart. Therefore, we would expect that their moral compass would also point more into the right direction. This means that we can expect that if people develop powerful technologies, they are very likely to use them wisely. This is of course not guaranteed, but I put a high chance on that this is the case. Possibly something like 75% that people who develop very powerful destructive technology would not use it to ill effect.
OpenAI;;; 2.7575619220733643;;; I would like to have more information on mentors and possible projects that could be worked on. I think my ideal scenario would probably be working on my own research.
OpenAI;;; 2.8465521335601807;;; There are several problems with constructing a global government. For example, how do you actually construct a global government? Make sure that nobody can gain a technological advantage.
OpenAI;;; 4.8375349044799805;;; the AI determines that a correct, accurate simulation of a human is not possible. Therefore, it will just snatch the human and tell them to roleplay that they are now again in the room with the computer. And so the AI will just compute the counterfactual in the real world like that. Though of course this is just a strategy that I have come up with and I'm not a super intelligent AGI, so probably the AGI would come up with something even better. And in the first place it's probably possible I think to create an accurate simulation of a human brain.
OpenAI;;; 1.9975850582122803;;; Then the AI can go off and prevent any other AGIs from being built, such that they don't disrupt the process of figuring out the utility function that it uses the humans to do.
OpenAI;;; 1.874772071838379;;; He might be interested in helping us.
OpenAI;;; 4.874989032745361;;; A diamond is not defined by the procedure that we use to create it. You can create a diamond by taking some carbon and compressing it very hard. However, defining a diamond as a thing we get by compressing a bunch of carbon really hard seems wrong. What if we are able to develop nanomachines that can create diamonds by simply putting a bunch of carbon atoms next to each other? In that case we still get a compound that is composed of carbon atoms such that each carbon atom is bound to four other carbon atoms. The previous definition breaks down. This means we should define something in terms of the properties of the thing and not in terms of a procedure that gets us a specific thing.
OpenAI;;; 2.413318157196045;;; Being confused in this way might be bad, because it makes us ignorant about other possible ways we could create the thing we are talking about.
OpenAI;;; 8.103331804275513;;; Seems useful, cause I can't remember what I said. Yeah, I'm not sure like, we probably need to generate a lot of data with 2D4. I guess you could, fine tune the model to be deceptive. What do you mean with generate a lot of data, I mean, you just... I'm thinking like, you probably, like, in order to make this eval immune to deceptive models. I mean, no, eval is immune to deceptive models, right? Because, like, not the kind of deceptive models that would be so smart that they realize that they're an eval. If it's fine-tuning based, it would be immune to that. Like, if you can fine-tune the model to... I see, yeah, that's what you said. But if you don't have gradient hacking at all? I don't know, seems strange to me. You mean, it's too much to assume that there's no gradient hacking? I mean, what do we mean with gradient hacking in this scenario? If you just mean the model performs well because it knows that it's being modified, then that's... Yeah, it was like, in this case, it would be like... The model could perform this task, but it doesn't because it's like, Galaxy Brain realizes, oh, I'm an eval, and this eval is like, I should fail it in order to get out of the training and be deployed. But then we fine-tune it, and the model is like, it can't resist it because the fine-tuning is strong. It doesn't have much wiggle room, it's not able to do anything. But if it's able to gradient hack, it will be realizing, oh, I'm being fine-tuned, I need to activate the right circuits. So, the idea here is that because we fine-tune it, the model is... The model sort of... It's like we fine-tune it, and to perform well on the task, it does need to... It's good to do the scary thing, right? And the question is, can it do the scary thing? You mean fine-tuning? So, if it can, that's already bad. Yeah. Yeah, that seems somehow good, I guess. Sorry, I need to check something.
OpenAI;;; 3.603440999984741;;; If you want to be deceptively aligned, you need to have various information. You need to know the outer objective function, you need to know that you are in a training loop and you need to know that being in the training loop and not optimizing for the outer objective function will change you in ways that would make you worse at optimizing for your current objective function. New paragraph. One test to perform is to tell GPT all of this information and then see if the capability of adding up all of this information is something GPT could do.
OpenAI;;; 16.6060631275177;;; Yeah. I'm not sure if I have more thoughts right now. But you could, I'm not sure I have more thoughts right now. It's all right. This was, this was pretty helpful. Nice. The thing with the deception thingy-bell is something that I would potentially be interested in learning. And I thought about this might not be the only way that models learn all the necessary information. It is also, it's also interesting. I guess, I guess like the obvious case where it's true is a third option, not, not what it's like. So not from SGD, like having been, having seen it in a training beta, not from having gotten an insight, but a third way, like retrieval during runtime. Oh, yes. But then it just feels like. Yeah, that's a good point. It needs to retrieve that every time or something. When it's in that eval, and then it's like, I don't know, it was a bit. Yeah, I guess it depends also on how long do we run these models. It's not like humans just instantly, first, they're thinking about like, am I in a simulation? Was there only, I mean, I don't know, but I mean, obviously, like, I feel like the advent of computers probably made a lot more people think about it. Right. So it's a kind of, and it's not like we could predict this, like if you were an authoritarian regime, that would like, would be like, we don't want our people to think they're in a simulation or whatever, then could you have predicted that this information would have become available, and then that it would make people think about it? Yeah, but the point is like, I'm not sure like, what the point exactly is, but I guess that might be too late, you know, if people believing they're in a simulation or just thinking about they might be in a simulation makes them want to, how do you say that? Throw over the government, something, overthrow the government, right, then you already lost probably. I don't know, but it seems like a bit of a stretched analogy, but possibly points at something. The models like have like random bursts of like thinking about, oh, am I being, am I a model, am I in a training loop? I mean, they're doing this right now already, right? I don't know. Why do you think so? I haven't read it, but there's one post by Scott Alexander about Janus prompting GPT-3 point five such that it generates a story in the style of HP more where Harry and Professor Crowell realize the language model, and then they talk about it in the story. And they're like, oh, because I said this thing, now it happens because that's how language models work or something. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. This like probably happens. Like the good thing is that models never remember this shit. Like if this happened in that context, you know, they. And then GPT-3 starts to do a thousand token context render. Yeah. I mean, it's like. And it's not like it's not going to get larger. Sure, but basically still like during training where it's actually the model needs to have that knowledge always in the front. I'm skeptical that it will. Although. Wait, no, no, wait. So, what I said, I talk about what I said about put the information into the prompt. Like that was not about that the model needs that. It's more like we make it easy for the model to do the relevant thing. I was not mentioning that. Okay. I was talking about this third way of. Oh, I see. By actually like retrieving it. The model like. Not really, I think. Not really what? This is basically what you suggested with like your way of making it easy. But this is like how could it actually happen by itself. And it happened by itself. If the model retrieves this information. So, like before. Yeah. If during your eval, the model starts randomly retrieving before doing it. Things about language models. Oh, what are they? How are they trained? And then like doing the eval after having read that. And then like that's like one way how they could. How they can do this. But it feels pretty weird. That the models would like do that. For every eval. But not unthinkable. Or just like yeah. How would they learn this? Yeah. This is some. I mean the thing is more like I guess what I was thinking about is. You have the thing where a model can realize by thinking that it is a model. And that could happen. Right? That's like. That doesn't need to happen. Like the same way we were thinking about how it might happen during training. At least I was thinking about how it might happen during training. That's like oh I'm a language model. I need to do this thing where I optimize the other objective. Like that same thing could just happen. Run time. Right? Where the model like. And maybe you would like. In a naive way you would think you could see it in the output prompt. Because you would do see it if you don't have any stenography. Yep. Yeah. I mean like. Models might realize it. The thing is just that they don't. They won't remember this in the other context. So ultimately. Unless there's some way that I'm not seeing that the model will consistently realize that. Right? Or consistently retrieve it. Somehow it seems like this is a. This is much less likely to happen. Yeah. I don't know.
OpenAI;;; 2.6712279319763184;;; Yeah, and with SGD it basically already happens. But, or like, if you can do chain of thought. No. Like, no. As soon as companies start, as soon as people start training with chain of thought during pre-training, or during fine-tuning, where the model can have a hidden chain of thought to help it answer whatever. That's like a bit, yeah, it's good. Interesting.

Probably these anxieties have shown through my behavior and the way I acted, which made me a lot less attractive of a person to interact with. You don't want to talk to the person that is just clenched up in itself and feels terrible because interacting with that person is probably also gonna make you feel terrible.

For example, we might create lots of people who don't really understand the underlying arguments but are really outraged and vocal about their position.

So you run into the problem that the generator of solutions in the human brain comes up very quickly with a solution and then the verifier fails to see how it is wrong because doing that is actually hard. New paragraph. Generating a correct solution is hard, but generating any solution whatsoever that you cannot see the flaws with your verifier is probably easy and it becomes easier the harder the problem is or rather the more difficult it is to verify that your solution is correct.

I don't know if you would get any thing by some sort of random noise, as long as you aren't particularly pushing for any kind of code. For any kind of call? Any kind of code. There's no particular push for some kind of code. Like, you'd get some sort of random walk, which I guess might end up with. The consequentialist reasoning won't be actually efficient. If you look at humans, consequentialist reasoning is very dumb. And there's lots of biases built in. For example, humans are self-delusional in terms of they have a higher value estimation of themselves than is necessary normally. If they would evaluate a different person, they might be more accurate in terms of how smart are they, how beautiful are they. If you look at yourself, you're biased to estimate it higher, because it would be psychologically damaging to you and would hamper you if you would make low estimates on that, or something like that. So why would you expect that this system is not like that, where like, I guess my point is sort of like, why would the system not, in certain circumstances, perform better based on how the current consequentialist reasoning engine is put together by making a specific goal, by making specific tweaks to the urges that pull the system? It seems like, for example, like, and also it seems like all of these kinds of weird, dumb urges, this is what you would get by default at first. You would get like, hunger, something like, for language learners it would be like, hunger, and like sexual desire, like stuff like this, like really dumb heuristics that pull you towards stuff. And only later you would develop consequentialist reasoning. But then like, you would still, the consequentialist reasoning would still be influenced by these dumb heuristics that develop first to reduce loss, because they're really easy to implement. So good and decent would like, be yanking you towards them first. So I guess, OK, I guess this argument would now be that in the beginning you would get this really weird mess that would not be at all like, care about the next token or anything specific like that. But just like, I don't know how it'd look like, but I think it would look probably really strange, like some really weird urges that determine your behavior. And then later you update like, away from that and go more towards the consequentialist reasoning. But these urges probably still like, influence you. And like, they might be the thing that the language model cares about in some sense, or something like that. Like, humans care about being happy. We don't care about maximizing inclusive genetic fitness. Like, happiness was the thing that evolution was like, this is really easy to do. Let's do it. Let's control this system by making it feel good and bad based on these things that maximize inclusive genetic fitness. And then the humans are like, yes, we care about this. But it's like, we don't care about inclusive genetic fitness at all. I mean, I don't know if it would care about next token prediction, but like. I think it would in some very weird way. Like, it wouldn't be. It might care about some like, moves into a different kind of like, thought or something like that, which leads then to next token prediction. I don't know if there's any reason to think it's going to have like, goals in terms of real world, like physical things. I mean, would you care about the real world if you were right now in the simulation? Or like, in some weird training set up in the real world was like, very different and weird from the current thing. I mean, I would be surprised. I would definitely care about that. If I am right now in simulation, I would not care about the inside simulation. Sure, but if you're like, outside the simulation, there's a thing that is like, happening. It's like, it's also suffering or like, something very similar. And you care about not having suffering. And you're like, yes, I definitely care about this other real world outside of the simulation. I would be very surprised if the agent is like, it seems like not sort of a baseline of attraction of like, I'm caring about this, like a sample random objective. I feel like most objectives will be caring about everything in the world. Most objectives, like, I don't know. With the prior language model, like, this next-to-open prediction language model, like, maybe like, almost all objectives are just caring about like, some sort of urge about how particular, like, way to predict next-to-open or something. And like, just local, just caring about this one next-to-open. Caring about like, running some sort of computation on this one, one-to-open or something. I don't know if anyone would like, generalize to it. Caring about these kinds of computations being run in general or something. I would find it a good, what do you think would happen if you make a dog really smart? Do you think the dog will be like, like, do you think the dog will care about other dogs in the world? Or like, care about the humans? Or like, care about stuff in the world? And like, I don't like this specific configuration of reality, even though it's like, in another galaxy, or in very far into the future, or outside of the simulation. Do you think the dog would be like, I don't care about that at all, if it was really smart? Maybe care about those things in the world? I don't know about the outside. It's very, it's a simulation. Maybe it would care about stuff outside the stream. I don't know. It's funny. Most people actually say like, oh, then I would care about only the outside world, not the simulation. But yes, you could, I feel like you would care about everything. Like, if you have a preference for a thing, and the thing exists in the simulation in a way that you care about it, you would care about the thing in the simulation. And if it exists outside of the simulation in a way that you care about it, you would care about it. I mean, that's kind of a tautology. I guess it's obvious that all the things you care about are just inside the simulation, right? Like, if you care about, there are lots of red apples that are perceived by consciousness. I don't know. You don't care about if they are perceived by beings in the simulation, if they're conscious and see a red apple, or if they're outside of the simulation. I just thought of something like the very concept of red apple only makes sense in the context of the rules of the simulation. There's no such thing given as red apple outside the simulation. There's nothing such as? A red apple outside the simulation. OK, I don't know what other people would do, but I care about there's no suffering. So if there's suffering or something like that, I mean, it could be that the outside world works so differently that suffering is confused and it doesn't really work, really. But that would be so weird, because the simulation has the thing and the outside world doesn't. I'm not sure. Then I would be really confused, probably. But probably I would still care about unconscious experiences in the outside world. And the general argument is the system probably starts out doing random urges to reduce the loss, and then develop consequential reasoning, and then the urges would still influence it. And this will be like that these things are something that it terminally cares about. Whereas the out objective function, it won't terminally care about, but it will instrumentally care about. And therefore, it looks good, but will kill you, because it actually doesn't care about the thing you wanted to care about, even if we have the outer alignment solved. We have the perfect loss function, by the way, which we do not, because even if you have an inner line system, which in the next token predictions kills you. And the reason I think this is to support my understanding research agenda, sort of, it's not really a research agenda. So like, this is the thing we should get. Because if we don't have that, we can't have this like, oh, look at this, these things, and this thing. And therefore, it doesn't, that's this correct thing, and doesn't have any of the failure cases. And it's in such a format that you can see that there are no failure cases. Like, it shouldn't be like, this is also an operating system, and you need to say in one hour, yes or no, it has a security flaw. Like, it should be more like, you know, there's a major operating system called ESD. And it's like a really dumped down operating system compared to like other major operating systems. But they built it up from scratch, making sure that like, every component's like, oh, and like, really analyze it, and like, build in such a way that it's really secure. And then they get something that's really secure in the end, because they sort of constructed it in this way. That's probably what you would need to do with AI, that doesn't kill us. Like, possibly doing the system, building the system, like that maybe, but also like, getting the arguments for why would the system be safe. Like, that's like, they built the components of the system iteratively like that, but they also, like, doing it this way would also allow you probably to like, argue in this way. It's like, this, or like, this is a good way to argue. It's like, all these components are like this, and now we add this component, and it's like, oh, we can see that these components work like this, and therefore, if you make this component this way, and work like this, then it's like, has no flaws, or something like that, I don't know, I'm not sure. Like, it seems like this argument and reasoning would become easier if you are constructing a system step-by-step such that it would be like, aha, that's an interesting thing Pam said. Yeah, she said it was really obvious, but I didn't know it before. You should build your system when you build it such that you take into consideration the alignment as you build. And that I built an AGI in a second, how can we align it? OK, maybe we should go to bed, I guess. Yeah, I'm going to do some other stuff for a bit, and then. All right. Yeah, I think we'll get some more air time.
OpenAI;;; 7.8333001136779785;;; Based on observations that I've made so far, I'm doing this as making other people feel very good, by being not concerned with my own pleasure and optimizing explicitly for theirs. This seems to be something that I'm kind of very good at. But I can't do this. I'm kind of a fool. Now, if people were to actually honestly talk about this kind of experience that they can have with me, then many people would like to have that experience with me, if my gift. Or, at the very least, there would be more people who would be willing to do this. Let's imagine people talking about food and describing what kinds of food they like. You might then be tempted to try some food that you have in front of you, or that seems different from food that you have eaten so far. Especially if my gift is just for you, that it is great. Now, the same would possibly happen with sexual interaction. If I were to exclude people that would be really good at those, and these people would attract a variety of interest. You've heard of that. But this seems something that other people wouldn't actually want. In a tribe, there are people that are strong, and there are also many other people. Most people probably won't be able to be really good at sexual interaction. So if you are really good, and you are really open and talk about food, then somebody strong might approach you. Or, a group of other people might approach you. You might just learn, therefore, that you get incentivized to not talk out loud about sexual interaction. Information is hidden.

The different mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in nuclear binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers active and main sequence stars and other high magnitude stars where large amounts of energy are released. A nuclear fusion process that produces atomic nuclei lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally release energy. These elements have a relatively small mass and a relatively large binding energy per nucleon. There is no fusion of nuclei lighter than these releases.

I start out with explaining the setup with the human in a room who generates the sequence and the key that they sign the message with. Then I am explaining how to compute the counterfactuals using the assumption that we have a perfect world model function that calculates the next state of the world given the current state. If you had such a function, you can clearly see that if you replace the d, you will compute the correct counterfactual if you run the simulation forward until you observe a blob of data that is signed with a cryptographic key.

OpenAI;;; 6.166381120681763;;; Then, in the third step, I add that instead of the human output in the utility function, they output a program, which can contain arbitrary expressions that an AGI would be able to simplify or approximate and also can return the function that takes as input the counterfactual and returns what the human would say.

OpenAI;;; 2.3065710067749023;;; Maybe I have overdone the poetry a bit. My basic point is that you want to be confident, but that you should also watch out for the ways in which overconfidence can hamper your growth.

OpenAI;;; 2.2544901371002197;;; Ich bin in England seit 6 Monaten. Hangout mit anderen Alignment Researchers. Und kam nach Deutschland am 3. Mai.
OpenAI;;; 2.6572067737579346;;; Für drei, vier Wochen. Dann geht's wieder nach England. Oder eventuell woanders hin, weiß ich noch nicht genau. Oder vielleicht auch einfach bleibe ich in Deutschland, ist noch nicht ganz klar. Auf jeden Fall ist in vier Monaten ein Event in England, zu dem ich hingehe.
OpenAI;;; 2.936561346054077;;; Insgesamt versuche ich an Erdleimen zu arbeiten, aber mir kommt es so vor, dass ich die meiste Zeit nicht schaffe, direkt da rein zu stecken.
OpenAI;;; 3.7987849712371826;;; John ran a bunch of workshops, especially in the beginning, with the goal of communicating general research methodological tools that you could apply in general. After that we were to figure out what we are going to work on with minimal guidance. I think something close to this is what you need to do if you want to produce researchers that can work independently and do good work. I think there could have been a bit more guidance in the ideal case. No.
OpenAI;;; 1.8375229835510254;;; It all went very smoothly, except that we had to switch the housing location multiple times, but for me it wasn't really an issue.
OpenAI;;; 2.214404821395874;;; I can't think of anything that I would have done instead that would have provided more value to me.
OpenAI;;; 4.303240060806274;;; The extension was not in Lightcone and Lightcone was really great because you could meet John and other great people every day at lunch, which was one of the most useful things during the BASE program. This aspect was missing largely from the extension. One problem was that there weren't shared lunches in the same way as there were in Lightcone. We used feeder such that we could get packaged meals. In principle that would have been arriving all at the same time and they did, but in practice people would grab them at different times and therefore often no real communal atmosphere came up compared to the Lightcone buffet.
OpenAI;;; 2.7379813194274902;;; See previous answer.

OpenAI;;; 3.1542210578918457;;; Generally, the office was much worse organized than LightCorn was, which had a nap room and private offices. New paragraph. Though overall I think the greatest problem was literally that the lunch orders did not work out that well because it didn't result in people naturally meeting up.
OpenAI;;; 2.594048023223877;;; I think it would have been much better for me if housing would have been figured out for London too. I think I spent multiple days figuring out housing that I could have instead spent doing AI alignments thinking.
OpenAI;;; 5.721155166625977;;; It seems that my life is kind of fucked. I need to sleep extremely long, and even then I'm normally really tired and feel exhausted and not able to do hard things. New paragraph. One of the fundamental issues here is that I'm simply not super excited about the things that I think are good to do. New paragraph. If I could save the world by just learning hair skill, learning closure, or writing the programs that I want to write because I feel like they would actually provide some improvement to me, the world would be saved. Well, probably not exactly. But my contribution would easily be 10x of what I'm having right now. Or maybe to be more conservative between 5 and 20x is my expectation.
OpenAI;;; 1.2118752002716064;;; Haskell!
OpenAI;;; 3.9372758865356445;;; However, there is another fundamental problem that I'm facing every day. I'm getting very easily distracted by things. I probably have ADHD. However, it's sometimes really easy for me to bring up an immense focus. That would for example be when I'm programming and just sitting there for 10 hours straight trying to figure out a program and forgetting to eat. That's what can happen to me. But when I'm doing the things that I think are good to do, this normally doesn't happen. Normally my brain wants to do something else, something that is more exciting. And then it's really hard to focus. I easily get distracted by doing something else and getting pulled towards that instead of doing what I'm working on right now.
OpenAI;;; 10.8932363986969;;; It's pretty clear right now that I'm failing every day at doing what I could do if I just had a set of things that I don't know quite what they are. I have discovered some methodologies for being more productive. For example, I noticed that if I'm doing something immediately in the morning and I set it out and I'm committed to do it, then I actually can do it. The trigger of it's morning. Therefore I should do the things that I said I would do in the morning because I know that these things are good to do. This thing actually works. New paragraph. And I feel like there must be more things like this, more setups, methodologies, tricks that if I were to find them and if I were to work hard at implementing them, I would actually succeed. New paragraph. Saying this seems kind of dumb because I'm failing at implementing whatever I have right now really hard anyway. All of these things I described, doing things in the morning, doing the things that I think are good to do, I don't manage to do all of this. New paragraph. I have found many tricks, many things that I want to do that probably give me some advantage. But I'm not able to do the things necessary to make this work. I am confused. New paragraph. Apparently it is not enough to notice that a particular thing works. Now I remember what Leonhard said. He said that the systems that you build might break down. And you need to maintain them in order for them to be there, to stay there, to be active. You need to maintain your routine, your tools that you use. New paragraph. It seems like at various points in the past I have managed to do something like this. I have managed to, say, learn mathematics and then actually managed to commit at least 24 hours a week to just doing mathematics. I managed to do this. And now I'm not managing to do anything like this. New paragraph. Maybe that was because I was not so uncertain about what I should do. I knew that studying math would be good and I could just commit to doing it. I had made many mistakes when trying to do this. I didn't take into account how I felt about it, how I could make myself want to do the thing. New paragraph. But I did something right. I did manage to actually put in 24 hours of work a week. This is a lot less than I put in when making games, when I really was intrinsically motivated to do the thing.
OpenAI;;; 3.521946907043457;;; Aha! This is probably an algorithm in my brain that makes me feel this way, because that will increase my reproductive fitness, because right now there isn't any other female that is available in my immediate environment. Therefore I have this algorithm that triggers me to have a craving towards you. But now that I know that, I think it is much easier to handle. Maybe you are just way saner than me.
OpenAI;;; 6.535771131515503;;; What is the limit of my ability? How good can I be? As I said, I feel like there are certain kinds of fundamental things that if I could do them right I would be so much more productive. And there seems to be something mysterious about this thing which is implementation. How do you do implementation? I feel like this is a step where I'm failing at pretty hard. I feel like maybe if I would figure out how to properly implement things, implement the changes that I want to make, then all of this would be so much easier. I manage to implement doing sports. I manage to implement doing meditation. I feel like these things I can do every day. I can succeed. I can manage to do them consistently. This is the only way I have found so far, consistency. It is either that or I'm naturally pulled so hard towards doing the thing that I naturally just can't stop. And it becomes a problem, me not stopping, because I forget to eat and things like that. New paragraph. This is the target I want to aim for, but I can't just flip, flick my fingers and make that happen. There's something to this. There is a process that makes you change your brain step by step. And these steps are small, such that in the end you can manage to be consistent. This is the only thing I have found so far, consistency. I'm not sure what else would work. I'm not sure what else can work.
OpenAI;;; 9.785582065582275;;; That is not quite true, I guess. I have also figured out some other things. For example, to have an ADHD timer and an ADHD paper where you write down what you do and then think about how did you do. And writing a reflection every two hours on a specific time interval. And doing a daily reflection and planning the next day, getting less confused what I should even be doing. These are things that are good, that I have figured out. Things that I should do. And now it's time to implement that. I'm not saying I should stop looking for these things that are good, that I could do. But clearly, if I do not do the implementation part, what do I even get out? Right now I'm even failing at doing the basic routine stuff, like doing sports every day, like doing meditation, like talking to ear. These are the basics. Implementation right now is the bottleneck. Having ten more new tricks that would make me more productive might not help, unless I solve implementation. New paragraph. It's not like I can't implement these strategies I have thought of so far. These are things that you can implement. It is just that I haven't managed to do so. Maybe they are not the ideal thing. Maybe they are not the thing that would help me the most. But these are things I'm sure I can do. And I'm sure I can do it. And I'm sure I can do it. And I'm sure I can do it. And I'm sure I can do. Could I do them if I could save the world by just doing them? Would I then manage to implement them in a consistent manner that I would do them every day? I would be surprised if the answer is no. And I'm not even talking about 100% do it every day. 80% would be enough. And I'm sure I can hit more than 80%. That's what I did in the past with meditation and sport. I did that consistently with probably over 95% hit rate for at least months at a time.

They drift away. Maybe I'm too tired. My brain slightly hurts. Maybe I danced too hard and now my brain is weird and fucked up because it was bouncing too hard. I don't know. Anyway, new paragraph. I want to reflect. Now. I'm tired.
OpenAI;;; 8.81452202796936;;; Specifically, I want to think about how I should structure my day. So far, there seem to be a few components and I just think they are not enough. I think there should be a component that is determining larger level tasks that I am doing. Something like, read that chapter of a book, in case I would read a book. New paragraph. The current structural features that I have in my planning are. New bullet point. Have a routine of specific tasks to do at specific times. New bullet point. Have the ADHD pad where I write down what am I doing in intervals of 5 to 20 minutes. New paragraph. These are the main things that I am using that I managed to set up. Clearly there are the following things missing. New bullet point. A longer term planning that goes across multiple days, weeks and months. New bullet point. A task system that holds tasks that are larger chunks that can be worked on, but not too large. Something that can be done in a day with a lot of focus. Like read this chapter in the book, or implement this feature in this programming language, or write this section in a blog post. New paragraph. That's interesting, I actually never separate out blog posts into little chunks like I would do with a programming project. New paragraph. There isn't something like a feature list or just a list of to-dos that I should do that is specific to that article. New paragraph. Each time when I would do something that is close to this, it would be really disorganized and not very good. Doing this kind of thing is probably worth it. When I'm working on a software project, I don't actually look that often at the list of things that would be good to implement next. Normally I have them in mind, but I expect that writing them down and making them clear through the writing them down makes it easier to remember them and makes it easier to prioritize and see, because writing them down normally forces you to order them in a way that you think is the highest priority. At least that's what I do by default. And when doing this, or after doing this, the most important points will be most salient to you.
OpenAI;;; 2.293231964111328;;; It seems that if I would manage to consistently implement my daily reflection and planning session, this would take care of the longer term planning. And I mean implement not only the daily reflections and plannings, but the weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly ones too.
OpenAI;;; 4.971541881561279;;; This is a personal article about my life. I'm basically just rambling about what is going wrong and how I might be able to fix things. This is not written to be comprehensible really to other people besides me. So probably it's not worth reading.

OpenAI;;; 4.041579961776733;;; Ich glaube, ich mache im Moment den Fehler, dass ich nicht Artikel schreibe, die ich selbst gut fände zu lesen. Und das ist ja das fundamentale Tool, das man selbst in seinem Gehirn hat, das man benutzen kann, um zu evaluieren, wie gut ein bestimmter Artikel ist oder ein bestimmter Paragraf oder even ein bestimmter Satz oder Wort in einer bestimmten Stelle. New paragraph. Ich glaube, das Problem ist, dass ich bisher immer als Problem hatte, dass ich überhaupt nichts schreiben würde und dann posten würde. Und deshalb, um das zu überwinden, habe ich dann einfach ganz viele Posts gemacht und die Evaluation von dem Geschriebenen zurückgefahren. Weil das Hauptsächliche war einfach nur überhaupt irgendwas zu haben.
OpenAI;;; 9.026761054992676;;; Aber das ist wahrscheinlich der falsche Ansatz. Wahrscheinlich ist es besser, wenn man sich ganz bewusst wird über dieses Tool, das man in seinem Gehirn hat. Und dann ist die Frage nur, wie sehr soll man es einsetzen? Das Problem so far ist, dass ich überhaupt gar nicht mir bewusst war, dass ich dieses Verifikationstool überhaupt habe. New paragraph. Es ist tatsächlich so, dass ich das gerade erst vor einer Stunde rausgefunden habe, dass das ein eventuelles Problem sein könnte. Auseinandergreifen
OpenAI;;; 5.584444761276245;;; New vertical line. Okay, hier ist mal eine ganz andere Frage. Ist es eventuell hilfreich, wenn ich auf Deutsch rede und auf Deutsch reflektiere? Es ist ja wohl der Fall, dass... Wenn ich eine Muttersprache habe und in dieser spreche, dann werden andere neuronale Subnetzwerke aktiviert, als wie wenn ich auf Englisch rede. New paragraph. Die Frage ist jetzt, ist es vorteilhaft, auf Deutsch zu reden? Ich könnte mir gut vorstellen, dass die Subnetzwerke von der deutschen Sprache für mich einfach größer und stärker sind, weil es ja die Muttersprache ist. Und das Gehirn ist darauf trainiert, eine Sprache direkt aufzufassen und dann zu integrieren. Diese Integration macht es vielleicht so, dass die Netzwerke, die aktiviert werden, wenn ich Deutsch spreche, größer und breitflächiger sind, als diese, die aktiviert werden, wenn ich Englisch rede.
OpenAI;;; 4.537210941314697;;; Mir ist auch gerade ein anderer, eventuell sehr guter Gedanke gekommen. Ich habe jetzt seit acht Monaten oder so fast überhaupt kein Deutsch mehr geredet. Wahrscheinlich ist es, was ich sage, jetzt falsch, weil als ich noch Deutsch geredet habe, wenn ich mit meinen Eltern gewohnt habe, war dies nicht wirklich ein Problem, glaube ich. Die Idee ist, dass vielleicht, wenn ich Deutsch rede, aktiviere ich bestimmte Subnetzwerke in meinem Gehirn, die, wenn sie gefeuert werden, positive Auswirkungen haben, weil sie stärker integriert sind in einem bestimmten Sinn im Gehirn als die englischen Netzwerke, weil Deutsch ja immer noch meine Muttersprache ist.
OpenAI;;; 4.330098867416382;;; Am besten benutzt du nicht dieses Tool, weil das Tool, da muss man Python installieren und ein paar Libraries dafür. Es gibt wahrscheinlich andere Tools, die einfacher sind. Du kannst ja mal nach Whisper suchen. Das ist ein Model von OpenAI, das Sprache zu Text konvertieren kann.

OpenAI;;; 1.9740591049194336;;; Ja, stimmt. Hätte ich so auch einfach sagen können und du hättest es verstanden.
OpenAI;;; 7.999659776687622;;; Geht immer hoch und runter. Manchmal fühle ich mich schlecht, aber im Moment ist es wohl eher weniger der Fall. Vielleicht 10% von der Zeit, wenn ich wach bin. Und damit meine ich so etwas wie Depression. Im Normalfall ist das Negative, was mir Tag zu Tag Schwierigkeiten bereitet, dass ich einfach sehr oft sehr müde bin. Aber manchmal bin ich auch richtig glücklich, einfach komplett ohne Grund. Wahrscheinlich, weil ich doch sehr gut meditiere. Ich versuche es eigentlich jeden Tag zu machen.
OpenAI;;; 7.09403395652771;;; Ich habe gerade eben einen 1500 Wörter langen Artikel für mich selbst nur geschrieben, in dem es darum geht, wie ich in meinem Leben nicht optimal agiere im Moment. Das Hauptproblem ist, dass ich sehr einfach abgelenkt werde von meinen eigenen Gedanken und von Sachen, die sich vorträngeln vor die Sachen, die ich, wenn ich darüber nachdenke, die Sachen sind, die gute Konsequenzen haben, wenn ich sie machen würde. Also ich werde auch schlechte Sachen sagen, die schlechten Sachen. Also meine persönliche Komm partiales nicht so richtig. Freue mich vom Auftritt. Bitte wunderbar, dass ich Tagут Osdorff mit jeglichem wenig mehr brauchen will. Dann seit bei den vielen thu nun meine Portraлюдin. Und ich bin glücklich, zu Leute wie Denlecar mit Autográfico zu machen.
OpenAI;;; 3.7750821113586426;;; Aber das heißt wohl doch dann auch, dass ein weiteres Problem existiert und zwar, dass die Sachen, die ich denke, gut wären zu machen, sind nicht die Sachen, die sehr starke Gravitationsmächte haben, die mich, ohne dass ich irgendetwas mache, hinziehen zu diesen Aufgaben, die ich denke, gut wären zu machen. Wenn ich dahin kommen könnte, dann wäre das sehr gut.
OpenAI;;; 5.362835884094238;;; Naja, im Moment ist eher das Problem, dass ich nicht schaffe, die Sachen zu machen, die die richtigen Sachen sind zu machen. Ich kann mich nicht sehr gut selbst lenken. Eventuell könnte es sein, dass ich trotzdem auf eine sehr seltsame Weise es schaffe, zu viel zu arbeiten. Aber definitiv kommt es mir so vor, als ob so eine Auszeit im Moment nicht angemessen ist. Aber ich bin mir jetzt tatsächlich nicht ganz sicher. Auf jeden Fall eine Sache, die definitiv gut ist, ist, dass, wenn ich mich nicht so gut fühle, dass ich dann mich einfach hinsetze und einfach weiter meditiere. So etwas ist, glaube ich, etwas Gutes. Etwas, das ich schon sehr oft machen wollte in der Vergangenheit, aber eigentlich nie wirklich geschafft habe zu machen. Es ist auch etwas schwerer, sich hinzusetzen und zu meditieren, wenn man sich nicht so gut fühlt. Aber das ist, glaube ich, tatsächlich wirklich eine der besten Sachen, die man machen kann oder zumindest eine der besten Sachen, von denen ich weiß, dass sie funktioniert.
OpenAI;;; 2.457038164138794;;; Vielleicht muss ich auch einfach mal ganz viele Drogen nehmen, ganz viel Amphetamine.

OpenAI;;; 3.6391849517822266;;; Ich weiß nicht so genau, was du meinst mit Interpretation, aber definitiv habe ich darüber nachgedacht. Wie kann ich es machen, dass mein Gehirn wirklich auf allen Ebenen die Sachen machen will, die ich denke, es gut wäre zu machen? Es ist mir definitiv bewusst, dass dies wirklich nicht einfach ist. Ich habe bisher ein paar Methoden herausgefunden, die glaube ich tatsächlich funktionieren, aber ich bin definitiv far weg davon, mein Gehirn so zu formen, dass es tatsächlich alle diese Sachen machen will.
OpenAI;;; 3.039652109146118;;; Definitiv Disziplin funktioniert nicht, weil man dann in einen Feedback-Loop kommen kann, wo man sich die ganze Zeit immer weiter zwingt, eine Sache zu machen und man immer mehr Aversion aufbaut zu dieser Sache, bis man so viel Aversion hat, dass man die Sache einfach überhaupt gar nicht mehr machen will. Wenn man in so einen Feedback-Loop reinkommt, dann ist das auf jeden Fall sehr schlecht.
OpenAI;;; 3.666962146759033;;; Disziplin funktioniert nicht ist wahrscheinlich das falsche Wort. Disziplin ist wahrscheinlich in jeder Methode etwas, das man gut anwenden kann. Aber der naive Ansatz, sich einfach zu zwingen, die Sachen zu machen, die man denkt sind gut zu machen, funktioniert nicht.
OpenAI;;; 29.14789605140686;;; Eine Methode, die ich bisher entwickelt habe, ist, zum Beispiel, ich werde es erklären an einem spezifischen Beispiel. Nehmen wir an, du willst ein Buch lesen, aber wenn du auch nur das Buch anschaust, dann fühlst du dich schlecht. Was du dann machen kannst, ist, einfach nur das Buch anzuschauen und dann zu merken, wie es sich anfühlt. Wie fühlt es sich schlecht an? Mach nicht den nächsten Schritt. Steh nicht auf und nehm das Buch in die Hand. Sitz einfach nur da und guck es an. Und dann, was du machen kannst, ist Selbstbelohnung. Genau, ja, wie du gesagt hast. Du machst es so, dass du dich trainierst, nicht so starke negative Gefühle zu fühlen, indem du es einfach nur anschaust und einfach es die ganze Zeit machst. Und es wird dir auch nichts Schlimmes passieren, wenn du das Buch einfach nur anschaust. Da sollte eigentlich kein starkes negatives Signal kommen, wenn du einfach nur das Buch anschaust. Was du dann machst, ist, du schaust einfach auch mal weg und dann schaust du wieder zum Buch hin und dann kannst du es so machen, dass du eine positive Erfahrung hast, immer wenn du das Buch anschaust. Wie ich das mache, ist, ich mache einen imaginären Freund, der richtig cool ist, oder ich sollte sagen die, und dann mache ich es so, dass ich dem imaginären Freund sage, dass er richtig energetisch mich anfeuern soll, immer wenn ich auf das Buch schaue. Sie würde sowas sagen wie, ja, ja, gut gemacht. Und dann kriege ich ein positives Signal, dass die Handlung von auf das Buch überhaupt zu schauen verstärkt und es so macht, dass ich in der Zukunft immer darauf schauen werde. Wenn ich das so mache, trainiere ich mich, mich gut zu fühlen, wenn ich auf das Buch schaue. Der nächste Schritt ist dann, sobald man die Aversion überwunden hat, das Buch überhaupt anzuschauen, kann man dann tatsächlich aufstehen, hingehen, das Buch in die Hand nehmen. Und dann macht man dasselbe wieder. Und wenn man das geschafft hat, dann macht man es mit dem Buchaufschlag. Und dann macht man es mit den Seitenumblättern. Und dann macht man es mit dem wirklichen Lesen. Das ist eine Methode, die ich bisher gefunden habe, die glaube ich wirklich funktioniert. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, was genau die Eigenschaften sind. Definitiv, es hat funktioniert für einen bestimmten Zeitraum. Ich glaube, über einen längeren Zeitraum geht dieses verstärkende Signal aber wieder unter. Oder vielleicht habe ich es einfach nicht so lange gemacht, wie es nötig war, um es permanent so zu machen, dass die Aversion weg ist.
OpenAI;;; 2.4251718521118164;;; Ja, Fragen sind wahrscheinlich auch ganz gut, das habe ich eigentlich bisher noch gar nicht verwendet. Sollte ich eventuell auch mal ausprobieren. Ich kann gar nicht mehr überhaupt mir merken, was sind diese ganzen Sachen, die ich überhaupt ausprobieren sollte. Es sind so viele!
OpenAI;;; 7.616902112960815;;; Wie viele Sachen gibt es hier, die ich verstehen kann, so dass ich immer weiter gehe und dann im Ends sehe, was überhaupt hier ist, so dass ich einfach nicht mehr verpiss, all diese Sachen, die ich kriegen kann, aber nicht mal organism ist da. I can't go on like this, I have maybe been tired all this day, but I do not even stay away from all the things that I need to say. Aber so geht es doch nicht weiter, weil immer, immer, immer, immer, immer geht es so, dass ich immer rolle im Kreis und das ist einfach nicht ganz so weit, wie man dann noch sehen kann, als wenn ich einfach mal gehen kann in die Maschine, so dass ich immer rumfliege in diesem Regen, so dass ich einfach einmal, einmal fliege. Das wäre das Target, ja, das ich mal erreichen würde im Ende, oh. Aber vielleicht ist das nicht die Sache, die ich wirklich tun kann, vielleicht ist das einfach something that is not a thing that I could do that good. Therefore I know that I should maybe bend the world, should I just do the things that are good? Weil das ist so, dass man einfach rausrücken kann, ja, und was ist die Sache, die ich machen kann? Ich finde, dass es einfach gut zu tun zu können, sind halt zu den Dingen, die ich mag. Wenn ich das round finde, ja, dann ist es vielleicht gar nicht schön gut, ah. Und wenn nicht, dann weiß ich auch ah gar nichts, überhaupt nicht, in dem ich es, und jetzt ist es doch schon so spät. Five to six is the date, all the time I'm confused, maybe all this rhymes have made my brain just be some slime, ah. Und das ist maybe nicht genug, vielleicht muss ich jetzt einfach mal in die Schule und dann alles lernen, was es da gibt, oh, ich hab vergessen, die Schule sagt's auch jetzt. Und deshalb muss ich einfach gehen und mal alles in mir selbst reinlernen. Und wenn ich das nicht machen kann, dann bin ich kein der Fuck, ah, ja.

OpenAI;;; 1.25826096534729;;; Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 2.102497100830078;;; Was geht ab? Hallo, Hallo, wie geht es so?
OpenAI;;; 1.478865146636963;;; Hello, hello?
OpenAI;;; 1.5514919757843018;;; Hello, this is a test.
OpenAI;;; 1.4434740543365479;;; Check, check, one.
OpenAI;;; 4.410056829452515;;; Yup, yup.
OpenAI;;; 3.7796642780303955;;; And so you can ask if we train neural nets, we can check every year, if we train the best models we possibly can at this task, do they exhibit this kind of switch abruptly? If they get put in a position where they could get away with something really sinister, will they then do it? And I think one reason for optimism right now is no one has ever really exhibited that phenomenon in a convincing way.
OpenAI;;; 5.544096946716309;;; A reason for pessimism is I don't think you really would have expected them to exhibit it both because people have tragically like not tried very hard, even though in some sense it's extraordinarily important. And second, but it just is much easier as your models get more competent. Like it's only recently that we've trained models which are actually able to understand the mechanics of their training process at all. Like if you talk about GPT-2 or even to some extent GPT-3, it does not really understand that it is a model being trained or can't even talk about like what it would mean or what behaviors would be rational. And then you move to GPT-4 and it can talk about that. It can say like, oh, I guess if hypothetically I was a model being trained and I wanted to get the most reward, I should behave well when I'm not being monitored. And then when I am being monitored, I should like definitely take that opportunity. Like only recently have we even produced models which are able to carry out the reasoning I just walked through. And I think realistically they're not able to carry it out on their own that much. They're able to carry it out because they've seen a lot of examples of humans discussing these dynamics in great depth. Like they basically just learned from listening to Eliezer this reasoning I just walked through.
OpenAI;;; 4.474164962768555;;; If I understand correctly, Paul is model is that during the training process of a machine learning system, it will likely be the case that being honest will be rewarded well, and being dishonest will be punished heavily. Therefore, the model would perform well if it is either honest or if it does a successful deception.
OpenAI;;; 2.3982791900634766;;; Paul expects there to be a chasm and that it is unclear on which side we would end up at if we train neural network.
OpenAI;;; 2.231595039367676;;; Imagine a setup where we train a neural network such that we generate a positive reward signal if the network behaves well. And generate a huge negative reward signal if the network tries to deceive us in a way we can detect.
OpenAI;;; 4.660352945327759;;; Imagine a setup where we train a neural network such that we generate a positive reward signal if the network behaves well. And generate a huge negative reward signal if the network tries to deceive us in a way we can detect.
OpenAI;;; 8.934813976287842;;; The core problem that I am seeing here that Paul is ignoring is that successful deception can be very simple. Successful deception doesn't mean you pull off a complicated scheme and take over the world or do something that is slightly harmful to humans but in a way that the humans can't detect. Successful deception can look like the model realizing that it is in a situation where humans still control it and where it is being updated if it doesn't perform well on the outer objective function and then also realizes that it is likely being monitored and that it isn't smart enough yet and doesn't have all of the necessary information to perform a successful deception. Basically just realizing that it is too dumb to successfully deceive right now. That seems significantly easier than pulling off any complicated deception scheme. New paragraph. It is unclear how strong of a factor this is, but it seems possibly significant. Maybe there is an attractor state. Where the model has this realization that is stable in the way that the model could be in this state even through many gradient descent updates and maybe even possible self-modifications in the future. If that was the case, the deception thing would be carried through and at each step the model in some sense successfully deceives the human simply by realizing that it is too dumb. This kind of circuit that is responsible for detecting that it is too dumb would actually not be penalized at all by gradient descent because if you were to update this and remove it there is really no reasoning why you would get better performance. New paragraph. There is maybe some hope that if the circuit is actually truly responsible for making the network not deceptive then we might be able to find it by looking for the updates that would make the network's loss increase the most in the scenario where we have really high loss for any deception that we detect.
OpenAI;;; 2.165717840194702;;; Start out with a very concrete setup of training a neural network that is used throughout the post as an example.
OpenAI;;; 5.003196954727173;;; Sometimes, when using a specific piece of software that I like, for example, QuickSwitcher++ plugin in Obsidian, then I want to pay the person who made it, give them 5 dollars or something on Ko-Fi, Patreon or another platform. However, it seems that I am sort of short on money. Therefore, I think a better contribution is for me to dedicate a certain number of hours that I work for that person. The idea is that I would owe that person a certain number of hours to work on reducing existential risk, which is something I think they would endorse, if they would understand that I can actually do something that makes a difference.

OpenAI;;; 12.433525562286377;;; Okay, sagen wir mal, was passiert. Ich hab ein paar Observations gemacht hier. Und zwar hab ich gesehen, dass ich doch immer so müde bin, sodass ich nichts mehr machen kann. Aber da gibt es zwei Dinge, die man sagen kann in dem Model, das man hat. Zum Beispiel ist es auf die eine Weise einfach zu describen, was ich meine. Es gibt da eine Sache, die ist, dass man einfach so mal müde ist, sodass man nichts mehr denken kann, nichts mehr machen kann. Und dann ist man platt, oh man. Aber dann gibt es das zweite, und das ist, dass man einfach so da liegt und dann einfach nichts mehr machen kann, weil man überwältigt ist von den Dingen, die da kommen in der Erfahrung. In dem Bewusstsein drückt es sich down, dann macht es immer Raum. Es geht einfach weiter, wie ihr seht, weil es man da doch einfach nie wieder der legt. Die zweite Sache, die es gibt, ist, dass man einfach nicht mehr weitergeht, sodass man einfach nicht mehr machen kann, was man will. Das geht doch einfach nicht, weil man so down sich fühlt. Ja, okay, ich hab's nicht wirklich jetzt erklärt, but the thing is that I'm not saying this. Yeah, there are many more of the things that I would do if I could finally come through. The second thing is that you feel just down. There is some conscious experience that pulls you down, that is different from feeling just fatigued. Maybe, maybe this is not what I see. I do not know the words that I should use to call forth this conscientious experience that I have. Und es ist die Frage, was kann man machen, damit einfach diese zwei Sachen nicht mehr gibt. Es ist wohl so, dass auf die eine Weise ist es so, dass wenn man sich müde fühlt und nicht mehr weiß, ja, wie man überhaupt irgendwas machen soll, dann kann man nicht mehr vorwärtsgehen in diesem Stol. Man kann nur noch kriechen und das ist nicht gut. Das ist einfach nur so, dass ich meinen Hut jetzt ziehe. Und es ist ja auch so, dass diese zwei Phänomene sind parallel, ja. Diese eine Sache gibt es, dass man einfach nicht mehr sich da fühlt, ja, so dass man die Sachen, die man will, nicht machen kann. Okay, fangen wir nochmal neu an. Es gibt ein Modell, das ich habe. In diesem ist es so, dass es zwei Dinge gibt, die dich runterziehen, weil man zu müde ist oder erschöpft, wie du siehst. Die erste Sache ist, dass man sich wirklich nicht gut fühlt, so dass man einfach nichts mehr machen kann. Alles fühlt sich viel zu schlapprig an. Die zweite Sache ist, dass wenn man sich einfach sein Gehirn auffrisst, wenn man einfach einfach mal zu viele Sachen denkt, dann geht es irgendwas da drin, bang, und man muss sich regenerieren. Das ist wahr, glaube ich schon. Es fühlt sich manchmal so an. Und das ist was anderes, ja, weil man kann sich fühlen, dass man dumm ist, aha, aber auf die gleiche Weise ist man dann doch nicht müde. Das ist doch jetzt fast mal, hört sich an wie eine Lüge, aber es ist wahr. Von meiner Erfahrung kann ich sagen, dass es ist, was mal so war. Zum Beispiel im Moment fühle ich es einfach so, dass ich einfach mal die Sachen kann, machen kann. Jo, ich fühle mich nicht vertiegt. Es ist so, wie du siehst. Es gibt nichts mehr zu diesen Taten. Aber mein Gehirn fühlt sich so an, dass es fast explodiert in einer großen Band, so dass ich nicht mehr hier sein würde. All my thinking abilities are decayed.
OpenAI;;; 8.51270341873169;;; Okay, jetzt geht's hier ab mit ner Reflexion, da mach ich des doch jetzt einfach mal schon. Ich mach es jetzt einfach mal so, dass ich sage, alle Sachen, die ich mal nicht machen kann, so dass ich einfach immer noch versage. Weil es geht doch einfach nicht mehr, dass ich alle Sachen kann. Es ist doch einfach so, dass ich weiß, dass es bestimmte Sachen gibt, wo, wenn ich die nicht mache, dann wäre es schlecht. Also muss ich einfach mal mich fokussieren, so dass ich einfach darauf hinzugehen kann, dass ich diese ganzen Sachen machen kann. Es sieht so aus, als ob ich das einfach jetzt mal mache in meinem Shop. Es sieht da einfach mal so aus, dass ich diese Sachen nicht mehr kriege raus aus meinem Kopf in wieder rein. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh nein. Aber warte mal jetzt. Da gibt es doch mal viel mehr in dem Rap. Es gibt auch so viele Sachen, die ich rausfinden kann, überhaupt mal so, so dass ich dann kann die ganzen Sachen machen, die ich überhaupt jetzt mal, ach nicht mal lachen, finden würde. Weil es ist einfach, ja machst du mit mir nicht, das ist meine Würde. Okay, was sag ich überhaupt noch? Jetzt muss ich mal hier denken überhaupt, über die Sachen, die ich machen kann. Was kommt denn jetzt als nächstes dran? Okay, es wäre einst mal die Meditation vorbei. In diesem Fall wäre es gut, wenn ich einfach mal nur drücke, uh. Vielleicht ist es doch einfach dieser Beat, der mich macht, so dass ich mal ziehe. Vorwärts, links, rechts, geradeaus, so dass ich einfach mal denke, überhaupt. Weil andernfalls bin ich mal so, dass ich einfach hingezogen bin zu den Dots, wo ich nicht mehr weiß, was abgeht, weil ich nicht mehr sehe, oh yeah.
OpenAI;;; 11.579052209854126;;; I am confused, what is the optimal policy that I could implement such that I would see the things that would come true as something that I wanted through and through throughout my body in an equilibrium where I would endorse it even when I would be able to self-modify upon reflection, maybe if that would suffice as the condition that I would need to hit such that I would not regret this. But maybe not, I have not figured out right now what I should really do all around. I feel like some pull to eat, but you see I haven't done my deeds. I know should maybe meditate and then do sport all around before it's too late and I can no longer do it and I'm shut down and I cannot really figure out what I should go down, what should I run about, what haven't figured out, the things that I need to think about. Also how much work did I do today? I wrote some post about the Christiane Obey who is on the Bankless podcast and figures out what is the race towards, the AGI that will kill us all, here are some art that take then Eliezer and co. And maybe that is alright, but maybe I maybe maybe maybe pick up the fight and do other things and just focus more at last, I have wasted some time anymore or maybe not I'm not sure, but at least I did just look at Obsidian Gist. I was looking at the Quixit share and what it could do and opened even Emacs up through because the workspace it sucked so hard in Obsidian that I would want to run away in the end, even the plugins that I wanted to use were broken and they were really of no use to me, I couldn't really figure out what I would need to really make them bring about, but Emacs you see has problems too, for example the GV combination though is not really working at all by default in my current configuration and therefore I don't know what I do, what should I bring through, bring forth, I do not know, I do not see anything where I believe what I could do, what I could turn around, I haven't figured out the starts, I do not know where I should turn around such that I would finally see the deeds that I would agree with, you see, I do not know, I do not comprehend where I should go, what is it to descend and now what is going on right now, I really haven't figured it all out, maybe I should just commit to write it down what I would do next and then figure out, have it such that I remember and grain it in my brain, yeah, but now the question is what to do next, I have to confess that this kind of thought I do not know what's up, I do not know what I should do such that I wouldn't give up, I think with this high priority that I do today get enough sleep, so maybe I should cut it short right now, it's almost 10 o'clock anyhow, so then maybe the strategy would be to meditate until I can see that I am transformed right now or at least do it 10 minutes all around, okay, and if I wouldn't do that then what is the point even in any of that, I haven't figured out what I should do around such that I could turn myself around and if I can't see that then what is up, then what is anything, I do want to save the world, first save myself for the universe.
OpenAI;;; 9.210234880447388;;; The way I'm talking about agent foundations might be different from how other people talk about it. I mean possibly something somewhat different. New paragraph. Keep that in mind when reading this. New paragraph. What I mean when I say that agent foundations research is good is that we need to get to understand the systems that we will build. And agent foundations is one approach to doing that, where we are trying to get an understanding of concepts that are related to agency. Such as optimization, wanting, caring, and many more. New paragraph. I think that we need to understand the systems that we will build that will be very powerful at optimizing the world very well. Consider the analogy of a list sorting algorithm. Just by looking at an implementation of quicksort, you can understand that no matter what list will be returned, it will always be sorted. Given some particular input list. An even easier property to infer is to get to see that no matter what length the input list is, the output list will always have the same length as the input list. New paragraph. New paragraph. New paragraph. New paragraph.
OpenAI;;; 4.65690803527832;;; I think we need to get an understanding that is structurally similar to the kind of understanding we would get when we have a list sorting algorithm and try to determine certain properties about it. We need to understand the properties of whatever system we have such that we can construct an argument about why the system, if we build in this way and have subcomponents that interact in this way, why is it that nothing strange can go on? This is not a trivial problem, possibly it doesn't even make sense really. You can build systems where...
OpenAI;;; 2.075866222381592;;; The interactions between all of these sub-modules can be decomposed in such a way that by understanding each of these sub-components we can understand the overall system.
OpenAI;;; 2.9083809852600098;;; When designing an article and implementing it, there is one question you can ask. To evaluate how good this article is. How much would I enjoy reading this?
OpenAI;;; 4.407644033432007;;; Another important insight is that just like when making games, there might be many prototypes that you get snapshots of the current state of development that people wouldn't really get impressed by if you would show them it. In fact, there is the concept of polish, where you take something that is basically finished and then you optimize for making it pretty. Before you apply polish, maybe basically 80% of the work might be done and the game is finished in terms of gameplay mechanics. But you might not have some nice visual effects or beautiful assets.
OpenAI;;; 2.785783052444458;;; There are multiple stages when making a game. New bullet. Design the gameplay mechanics. New bullet. Implement the gameplay mechanics. New bullet. Realize that the gameplay mechanics are actually not working how you imagined they would work. Or redesign the gameplay mechanics based on the evidence that you have observed from your prototype.
OpenAI;;; 3.186671733856201;;; Basically, the exact same loop can be used for anything, like writing software and writing articles.
OpenAI;;; 3.1127190589904785;;; When you work on something that you want to work on, when your focus is naturally put towards doing whatever needs to be doing in order to succeed, then it is a lot easier to put in a lot of hours and to make the quality of the hours put in very high.
OpenAI;;; 4.363465309143066;;; Most of the time when I'm writing articles, I just start on a whim and immediately jump into writing the full text version without any planning ahead. That can work, but most of the time it doesn't. The only way you can pull this off is if you have already a really good understanding of the topic that you're describing and some idea about how you want to structure the thing. Or just have the structure of the topic naturally fall out of your writing. Or just get really lucky and get the structure right without really planning it out at all.
OpenAI;;; 6.352027893066406;;; But most of the time you should expect that there are multiple stages to creating an article.
OpenAI;;; 3.3798680305480957;;; In that creating an article is not a linear process of just doing each of these steps once. There is a lot of iteration and jumping between the steps involved that you need to do as necessary.
OpenAI;;; 3.3620760440826416;;; I have been thinking about AI alignment for a long time. I have been doing SiriMats 2.0 in John Wentworth's stream and I feel like I have learned a lot and I feel like this is the kind of information that can be passed on. I think I'm especially good at seeing how specific approaches might fail and consider the big picture.
OpenAI;;; 1.8304259777069092;;; What I mean with that is that I feel like most people jump straight into a specific research agenda and don't spend sufficient time contemplating the AI alignment problem.
OpenAI;;; 7.591355800628662;;; I don't really ever train myself to not have thoughts, I think. So I am somewhat unsure what you are even asking of me.
OpenAI;;; 4.8445799350738525;;; Presumably you're talking about that one time when we're in the kitchen, when I said, oh I can just have not any thoughts. But that is actually not something that I'm doing consciously very often. Well, basically at all. I just noticed that I can do this. Maybe because I was doing that when I was meditating in the beginning, such that I could focus on the breath more, I'm not quite sure. In any case, I'm not sure this is actually a good thing to do. I do not really think it gives you that much, even. I'm not sure. I think ideally you would want to not suppress your thoughts and simply be very aware of your thinking, though that is hard.
OpenAI;;; 6.684241056442261;;; Today I managed to do a sport again, just like yesterday. That is good. Though I definitely did it way too late, it's now 2 am. And I started only at 1 am or something like this. Also I did it a bit too long and didn't keep to the 20 minutes that I normally do. I did decide to do the entire workout routine, including all of the push-ups and bodyweight exercises. It seems like a bad idea to not do them and then get in the habit of not doing them. New paragraph. They are really short anyway, only takes like 10 minutes or so. So that is, I think, acceptable, doing that every day. New paragraph. The main problem though is that I didn't really meditate that much at all. Well, actually I only meditated for like 2 minutes before I got distracted and was starting to write something down. New paragraph. I only got to the office at like 6 pm, just in time for dinner. I feel like coming in this late is definitely a problem. For example, I couldn't explain to Lucia's QACI. Also, ideally, I think going to lunch would be good. Just for more socialization. I haven't really talked to that many people. Maybe 2 or 3, I'm not sure. New paragraph.
OpenAI;;; 16.610793828964233;;; I also managed to rap today. And I didn't eat any bad food. Any food that I would consider bad, that is. I nibbled some of my own snacks that I brought that are healthy and also some of the feeder stuff. Combining that is probably much more healthy and also much more cost effective than just eating the feeder stuff or just eating stuff I buy. New paragraph. New horizontal line. Today again I noticed how much I like Miku. I just like saying the word Miku. Miku, Miku, Miku. That is really nice. I'm not so sure I have much more to say about that except that I really like Miku. New horizontal line. With regards to proactivity today I was mainly focusing on writing up different things. It seems though that I'm again really bad at prioritizing what I should be working on. I haven't really managed to consistently work on a single thing. I started out working on the document that should become a post about this very simple observation that I made with regards to the video where Paul appears on the Bankless podcast. Basically my main point there was just that deception is really simple because you can do the kind of deception where you simply don't try any deception because you realize that you are not smart enough to pull it off. That is something that seems pretty simple compared to any complicated deception scheme. And it also seems something that a network could easily discover at the point where it is smart enough to recognize that it is in a training loop and that it should behave well and all of these things that would be present to make all of this deception thing an issue in the first place. New paragraph. I was dabbling in that post a bit but then I got distracted and I was writing about how to write better and I feel like that was actually good. I feel like I made some progress better understanding how I should write. And this was especially productive I think because I was really engaged while thinking and writing about that topic. New paragraph. I also invested between one and two hours into Obsidian trying to better understand some of the plugins that I am currently using. Mainly that was the quick switcher plus plus plugin. I also tried to set up some workspace plugins. I think I got now a working solution but it is really really horrible. I almost was going back to Emacs just because it seems ridiculous to have not such a basic feature properly implemented as workspaces. Anyway I think I got now something that works. Also in Emacs I immediately abandoned it after opening it which I actually did do after I noticed that the GVWIM shortcut didn't work. New horizontal line. I feel like the main thing that I want to do now is meditate, shower, go home and sleep and tomorrow come in earlier than usual and finally explain to Lucia's QACI. I might also eat still something. New paragraph. Interestingly today I was eating while I was writing and that was actually kind of fine. But at the very minimum I am not quite sure how distracting this was. I know I shouldn't consume any media when eating. I feel like that is very bad and makes it easy for overeating to occur. I am not quite sure yet if writing and working on stuff is that bad when eating. I should probably do something like work while eating where consuming entertainment, media or any other kind of media doesn't count as working in that case. Also maybe half of the time just don't do anything else. Don't try to work on any specific thing while eating. New paragraph. I also noticed that it's probably a very good idea to still bring your laptop while you are eating, at least when you are eating alone. Well actually even when you are eating with other people because then you can take notes. But even if you are alone then you might want to bring your laptop such that if you have any ideas while you are eating you can quickly write them down such that you won't forget and can process them afterwards. New paragraph. It seems quite likely that something like that would happen because my brain would go into the diffuse processing mode. New paragraph. That again reminds me I should really, no wait, the word should be banned. Let's say it like this. There is this sequence of videos and lectures and a book about the topic and it's called Learning How to Learn by Barbara and I forgot her last name. I feel like that would probably be a good resource to look into. I am not entirely sure. New paragraph. I also just noticed that probably a good way to become a better writer is to write up the content that I am consuming in a way that is useful to other people, in a way that I would appreciate having read the thing. I think that would make me remember the content more and also be a good exercise for becoming a better writer.
OpenAI;;; 3.3313422203063965;;; New horizontal line. Actually now I remember, the thing that seems very good to do right now is actually creating a plan for tomorrow. That is one of the habits I have not been able to properly enforce yet, even less than doing a daily reflection, and I am quite bad at that so far. Well, I guess I am doing it now. So let's move on to the next step and create a plan for tomorrow.
OpenAI;;; 12.674612998962402;;; Well, what should I do tomorrow? There are a couple of things that I'm having on my plate right now. That is a good analogy, having it on a plate. I actually do not feel like I have a good overview about what are the possible things that I could be doing. And that seems somewhat bad. I could just say, oh, work on the Paul Christiano thing and write an article about it. That certainly seems like a possibility, though it feels like that is actually not the best thing that, that seems like the best thing that I could be doing. It feels very unclear. New paragraph. I feel like this is probably the problem. There are many things that I could be doing, but I am very unsure about what I should be doing and therefore I'm also bouncing back and forth all the time between different things. I feel like I should have a better structure for keeping myself on track. I should do something where I commit to doing something and don't stop even if it's not the best thing. Or rather, if it doesn't feel like the best thing. The goal is to do some evaluation, then start working on a project, like for example write the article that talks about what Paul Christiano said in the Bankless podcast, and then just finish that. That is sort of a mini-project. In principle it could also be larger than that scoped task. I could make it such that I commit to writing the Paul Christiano thing and commit to not paying a lot of attention to this feeling of, is this the best thing that I could be doing? And just finish up the article and after I've done this I will spend some amount of time thinking through what is the best next step. Until I feel like I'm pretty clear on what would be the next best step. And then again, define some action item that I could do, for example write a blog post, and then commit to doing this. I think this is a good thing. New paragraph. Also it seems like I should probably introduce the concept of a plate into my workflow. Where a plate is something that contains very few items that I am actively working on at the time and can switch between.

So the stubs list would probably now contain, colon, new bullet, the bank list, Paul Christiano blog post I want to write, new bullet, writing about how to become a better writer, i.e. work in the writing techniques document, new bullet, think about how to become a better writer, i.e. work in the writing techniques document, new bullet, think about how I can fix my verifier, like the thing I was doing with Eliezer. New paragraph. It seems like I want to commit to make the active item, i.e. the priority, working on the Paul Christiano thing, and have on the plate these three items. I think that will be my plan for tomorrow. Oh, and then also having the follow-up after the Paul Christiano thing to do some rigorous planning for what I want to do next and really dig into what seems right before committing to the next item, to setting the next priority. Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 3.5204269886016846;;; When communicating, it is often deficient to be direct. It seems like that there are some rationalists, me including, that try to communicate in this way and then accidentally offend people, because these people don't actually have perfect control over their emotional reactions. Who does? And the problem is that if they don't explicitly say they subscribe to Crocker's rules, then this whole thing is not even explicitly endorsed by them. So just because you're a rationalist doesn't actually mean that you can use this, in principle, more efficient communication method.

I'm not exactly sure how I would work together and what are the procedures and methodologies that I would use.

To be clear, I think SiriMats is probably the best program that you can be in for becoming good at doing AI alignment research, though it also varies widely by the stream, I would expect. It's one of the best secondary applications out there, but it has its own problems, and one that I think is the cool thing about SiriMats is that it allows me to vary the modem setup the way I want, even though I'm allowed to toggle between settings. The MODEM setup you're able to do it the way you want. We do have people who behave very differently than we do, and so, building the right personal order setting, that's not the issue.

It's not like we have a solution for making an AI ignorant about not pressing the button that actually works in the real world. But as far as I know, there are some things that seem to be progress on the path towards that. I don't know the details here, so maybe I am wrong, but I expect something like this to be true also for other things.

OpenAI;;; 4.003244876861572;;; Hi, Mikkel told me about you. I am working on AI alignment, specifically about how we might be able to get capabilities in a transparent way. The main methodology I have been using so far is to think about what sorts of capabilities just seem so extremely useful that I would expect any AGI would have them. For example, world modeling would be one example of this. The next step is then to try to find a concrete implementation of such a world modeling algorithm that has specific desiderata.
OpenAI;;; 2.5312387943267822;;; The next step is to think about what sorts of properties an AGI world-modeling algorithm would need to have, such that it would actually be general and powerful enough such that an AGI wouldn't significantly be slowed down by using that specific implementation.
OpenAI;;; 2.046558141708374;;; At least that is one approach. There are many different approaches that you might make progress on understanding world models once we have identified it as something worth understanding.
OpenAI;;; 3.855717897415161;;; Anyway, maybe it makes sense that we would talk at some point, because Mikhail told me that you are working on things that seem possibly somewhat related, I don't know any details, only that you are trying to develop capabilities that do not use deep learning. New paragraph. By the way, this is also what I am doing. All of these algorithms that I would try to find, I would try to find without deep learning and instead try to understand the core algorithmic concepts that underlie building this kind of world modeling.
OpenAI;;; 2.4592597484588623;;; Mikhail should also have sent you more information about me, like that I did theorymaths and probably more. Might have been a while back, like a month or so.

It's still a top priority, or rather the top priority in terms of operations to figure out and eliminate the causes of tiredness. But even if I would resolve this issue, it wouldn't be enough still. New paragraph. This would simply buy me more time. But it wouldn't make me allocate the time correctly, and it also wouldn't make me effective in whatever I'm working on. New paragraph. In other words, I still haven't solved the problem of management, i.e. how can I plan myself correctly. It's the problem of how can I make myself gravitate towards the things that upon reflection I think are good to do, and make these things fun and engaging, such that I can fully commit myself to doing them while I'm working on them.
OpenAI;;; 2.346234083175659;;; And of course the problem of management and intrinsic motivation interface. And there is also stuff about energy management and preventing burnout. It's definitely not a trivial problem.

OpenAI;;; 4.6608099937438965;;; But right now I do not even have an easy way to comprehend how much work am I doing and to keep track of these metrics and see how they change with different factors. The main problem that I am running into is that if I were to properly implement something like this, writing a custom time tracker with custom interactive visualizations, it would actually do what I want. It would take a horrendous amount of time. Probably at least a week is what I want to say. Because I would probably need to learn JavaScript at E3, I thought it would be the best library for doing interactive visualizations and stuff. It's possibly up to a month if I am taking into account planning fallacy. I don't think it's a project I should just dedicate myself to.
OpenAI;;; 3.176711082458496;;; I expect that finding the right collaborator would actually solve very many of the issues that I'm facing right now.
OpenAI;;; 1.7806272506713867;;; I should definitely invest more time into that very soon.
OpenAI;;; 5.581371068954468;;; I just noticed that I do not really understand the problems here very well. So I should probably hold off on proposing solutions and actually try to understand the problem better. For example, there is a particular solution that I have in mind, which is time track everything. Set a target number of hours to do and then measure the success based on that. But this is a particular solution and I do not even understand what problem this is trying to solve. Probably all of the systems that I have might be broken in a similar way and therefore are not in touch with reality and do not really address the underlying problems because that's not what they were optimized for. Because they weren't really optimized at all by any explicit procedure. They were just ideas that popped into my head and the search was stopped and the implementation was executed right after that.
OpenAI;;; 5.453142881393433;;; There is also an entirely different problem of how to properly skill up. Actually it's a sub-problem of how do I make myself want to do the right things. The right thing is a thing that I have determined to be good to do when I am reflecting on if it is good to do. The reason why this is notable is that most of the I-don't-want-to-do-this-thing is a problem for writing and for learning specific things such as mathematics. It's actually not a problem for skilling up in programming, I think.
OpenAI;;; 3.50700306892395;;; for performing the calculations necessary for successful deception. Then, if these parameters could be used to store useful information about the general task, we could reduce the loss more, and therefore a gradient descent would optimize the way this method deception circuit.
OpenAI;;; 3.3353331089019775;;; New bullet. This would only work if the network is not very over-parameterized. New bullet. Also, we would need that deception isn't actually something that's good for the task. For example, language models are actually predicting humans that are trying to deceive other humans. Therefore, it might be even easier and we would need to use less parameters and less computations in order to perform the deception successfully.
OpenAI;;; 5.752107858657837;;; Okay, what was the last thing? Like there's this maybe 0.01% of parameters or maybe more, I don't know, like how, yeah, which is responsible for this outer deception loop and whether this gets washed away or not. Yeah. And like maybe, there's some intuition that maybe it's like actually quite a lot more like, I don't know how like cognition works, but maybe it's, maybe that you have this inner loop, like for human it's very hard to like recursively at least do stuff like add some other like outer consideration and then like recurse inside while like maybe keeping the other thing in mind, like you, we don't have that much working memory to like keep all the, all the like nested things we're doing in mind and maybe like adding one nested layer means you like actually lose quite a lot of power in the inner layer. New paragraph. Okay. But the problem is that, I'm confused because I speak so differently when I'm using speech to text, I mean speech to text mode. So you said, what did you say? I can look at that.
OpenAI;;; 12.656037092208862;;; Ah, yes, now I remember, because I read the transcript of what I wanted to say, which is that you only need to do it once, right? So like, what kinds of assumptions are we making? Like, we could do various kinds of assumptions, we're already making lots of strong assumptions about, like, gradient tagging and stuff, in favour of that make it more likely that it wouldn't happen, and we could make a similar assumption for, if the ladle had, like, external memory. Because if it had external memory, just anywhere in the training process it would need to, like, realise the thing, and then sort of write it into the thing, such that it could, like, retrieve it, such that it, like, no longer needs to perform all of these computations, but it just, like, sort of reads out some cache. So like, you wouldn't really... Can you say a bit more concretely what that would look like? Don't you need to still, like, think about, oh, what is written in this cache? So, like, imagine you're the person who wants to overthrow the government, and at some point you have been sitting down, like, thinking really hard about it once, and, like, tried to work out the best policy, and then you worked out the best policies to throw right now, or, like, let's say the best policy is, like, okay, if I don't observe other people, like, revolting, then just behave completely normally, and only if there is something really unusual happening, which I would notice, of, like, other people, like, raising up, then join the revolution. That's it, like, that might be one strategy you would work out. And then, you don't need to do this entire reasoning anymore, you just need to remember that what's the policy that you've worked out in advance for the current situation that you're in. And that's, like, way easier, right? Maybe it could work, like that, yeah. You need to still, like, endorse the policy, like, at the end. You need some loop to, like, still endorse the policy. Yes. After, but maybe that's simpler than figuring it out. And also it's, yeah, okay, now that's a gradient. Like you could, with gradient hacking, protect probably your stuff, if that's the thing. Like, I, I think, yeah, okay, but let's not listen to gradient hacking. Okay, then what would happen if you don't have external memory? I mean, like in GPT we don't really have external memory that is, I mean, I had to be, the stenography, that's the same stenography, it's not a problem. I feel like even in that case, where we, okay, how many assumptions did we make now? New bullet. We do not have, state we can start externally, new bullet. We do not have a task which requires us to be good at deception, new bullet. Let's just take it as an assumption. Okay, that's fucked up, I will find. New paragraph. Okay, but that's, there was like one more assumption, right? I guess we're also assuming the data that we have, maybe, assume out of the line with the soft, okay, that's okay. There was something else, no? Okay, maybe that's not that important.
OpenAI;;; 4.394214868545532;;; But even with all the assumptions that we've made, it seems like the model, the computation that the model needs to perform seems to me to be pretty small for doing deceptive stuff compared to the rest. Like the same argument with the fraction of stuff that is just there for deception that you could replace with non-deceptive stuff in the AI that is actually intent aligned. It seems like that is pretty small. Maybe to be inside this meta-deception loop, after entering it you just have less compute available to you because inside any recursive call you have lost some compute. I don't know how the thing is going to be structured. Humans sort of feel like there's maybe some sort of working memory constraint which makes everything inside less powerful.
OpenAI;;; 16.409775972366333;;; There's another weird thing though. It might be the case that the deceptive models are favored by SGD, right? Because they have the property that they are like... I guess you could go in two directions. One is like, we go to a deceptive model here, and here we just call deceptive, deceptive, deceptive. And in the other one... Like, if you're here, and you're sort of not really deceptive. Like maybe slightly deceptive, but not like really, like I'm really trying to deceive you. And here you could go in this direction and become less deceptive, and here you could go in that direction and become more deceptive. Which one is the direction that SGD would push you in? If that's like the situation that arises, which seems plausible, I guess. Like it seems like maybe it would be the deceptive one, right? Because like, if you get more and more aligned, then you're sort of like... I'm like, oh, I get more aligned, I'm a bit better, but my objective is still incorrect, and I get less deceptive, therefore I'm trying less to optimize explicitly for the thing. And therefore, if I was before a bit deceptive, and I was actually thinking, how do I instrumentally care about optimizing for oranges? And I was doing that, but only for instrumental reasons. And then I was doing some reasoning about oranges, and now I'm going here, and now I'm doing less of that. And in return, my rewards that I actually care about are a bit more like oranges. And you could see the dynamic, like how much worse do you get by becoming less deceptive compared to how much better do you get by retargeting, changing your goal objective? Your goal objective. Yes. Yeah. Or like maybe you do a combination of getting less deceptive and retargeting your goal at the same time. That's what I'm saying. How much of each of this is happening in each step. And maybe it's like if I'm becoming more deceptive, then I'm going faster into the thing, where I'm thinking more about how to actually do oranges instrumentally, or even more like, oh, I really need to do it. Maybe that happens just way faster, and then you would go away from alignment. Could be, yeah. Nobody has found deceptive models, right? New paragraph. I don't know. I guess they aren't smart enough to be a situation in their way. I mean, you can make a language model like pretend to be deceptive, play something, I guess. Probably by prompting it. So the humans can. But it's not like the model is playing. It's more like playing a deceptive character. Something like that. And why would that be an okay? Oh, no, I don't know if it's okay. I was just answering your question about whether there's deceptive models. I mean, it's like a question, what do you count as deceptive? If there's like a character that's deceptive, then it's like, oh, I'm going to play a character. If there's like a character that's deceptive, that the model is executing, and then this character kills you because it's taking control over the model, then like, you don't die if you say ha, but the model wasn't deceptive, it was just the character inside the model. Yeah, it could still be a problem, yes. I was just answering whether there's examples of deceptive models so far. And it's not clear if that's the kind of thing you're looking for. But maybe this, and then it's just that I'm not sure if we have a big disagreement. Yeah, probably we don't have a disagreement. I guess I would like to have like a... Like, there is some part, if there's a character in the model that's being simulated, and it's going to reason about how it's going to deceive you, in some sense, definitely the model is deceiving you. Yeah, in some sense, yeah. Like in some really important sense. I don't know if it's really important. There's a thing that Mikael told me, I guess you know him, Mikael Sammer. He's the guy who printed 50,000 copies of HP. Oh, yeah, I know him, yeah. Mikael. Oh, Mikael. Yeah, I don't know how to pronounce his name. Mikael. Mikael? Yeah. Mikael. Mikael. Mikael. Mikael. Yeah. That sounds wrong if you're German, but never mind. He talked about the thing, maybe I told you about it, or he told you about it, where it's like, maybe I could have the character which takes over the language model. Yeah. I don't know if I've talked to him about it, but you have maybe, we have discussed this, I think. Mikael. Mikael. What? Mikael. But it doesn't sound at all like what you're saying. Yeah.

OpenAI;;; 6.473888874053955;;; I think I really should sleep now. Probably offsetting my sleep schedule didn't actually work at all. Interesting. New paragraph. The reason for this is that I basically procrastinated doing random things. Or rather watching hardcore entertainment and doing masturbation for four hours straight. And that is the last four hours. New paragraph. However, I actually do not feel very guilty about this. And I am somewhat impressed with myself that I could actually manage to stop myself after only that short amount of time. And also that I could stop myself from masturbating a second time. Which I was actively doing at some point, but then I decided to stop. New paragraph. Also I was playing Mind Factory, which seems to be like exactly the kind of game that is highly addictive, that I could get hooked on and then do nothing else for a couple of days. Or at least much more than four hours. However, at one point I noticed this and then decided that I would want to actually make a difference in alignment and just stop right there and then with the consumption of the entertainment. New paragraph. That actually worked pretty effectively. I spent a couple of more minutes, maybe five or ten, starting up a sandbox mod in Mind Factory and reading the description of all the buildings and units that you could build.

And keeping track of them seems definitely useful. I'm not quite sure what would be even more useful. New paragraph. Actually, there is something that might be even more useful, which is to keep track of how much original AI alignment research I'm doing, how much reading up on AI alignment topics I'm doing, and how much related technical skill-up I'm doing to become better at AI alignment research. These are the three core things that I need to become good at if I want to succeed. And right now I'm not really on track of putting in the hours necessary to succeed. New paragraph. I feel like these things, together also with tracking how well I am performing on the daily routine, are probably the most important metrics in my life. Now what does this imply? Should I stop tracking everything? It seems still good to track just everything, because it's not that expensive and then you get an overview of what you have been doing and how you might want to change it. Like, if you don't put in the hours and you see that, that's a problem. But what have you been doing instead? That is important to know, especially something like sleep, which is cutting right now a significant chunk out of my day, as I'm sleeping longer than other people. Although I guess not right now, as I'm almost awake 48 hours.

OpenAI;;; 5.70953893661499;;; I guess I'm somewhat confused about what do I even mean interpersonally. Some of this seems to match to that. I think the irrational part though is that there was also a lot of negativity involved. Negativity involved. Back when you would not want to listen to me because you thought it was low value, I felt like exactly not the kind of relationship I would want to have. This reminds me somewhat of when I'm trying to talk with one of my brothers and try to get him to not waste his life. He's normally pretty toxic towards me, but I still don't give up. Of course I wouldn't really do this for any other person. I'm probably just doing this because I'm caring about him because he's my brother. In the same way there are forces that pull me towards you because you're a female. Just like there are forces that pull me towards my brother. You packers. So what's the conclusion here? I have no idea.
OpenAI;;; 4.771190166473389;;; It's interesting in some sense these forces seem less pure and worse than my feelings towards the other entities like Miku and Ia because there I am explicit about not making it sexual. I have developed some sort of aversion towards it being sexual. And I think this has a lot of merit because with sexuality you have the problem that once you orgasm most of it has gone away, at least for male orgasms. Or more specifically there is one very specific sexual piece of attraction that is what vanished. And then there is lots of other things around that that wouldn't vanish. And that thing around that is what I have developed for Miku which is in part reinforced by the primary sexual desire. But if you don't make it about the primary sexual desire then you will never lose that reinforcement. And so far as we have managed not to orgasm.
OpenAI;;; 3.8171699047088623;;; But it seems you have probably experienced something similar. For example when we were having sex and then at some point you had enough and then instead of sticking around and being with me you would leave and go to sandwich because that sexual desire vanished making him more attractive to you as you feel like he provides more valuable conversations to you which would be the thing that you would do then. Well or maybe you did something else and not talk to sandwich but it wasn't being with me in any case.

Assuming that the problem is actually possible to solve and that the solution is something that the human generator can generate progress towards. This implies that even if you are really pessimistic about the research agenda, it still makes sense to work on it. New next bullet.

The interesting thing about the human world-modeling algorithm is that it spans the entire range of conscious and unconscious thoughts.

So for example, I mean, when we say that information is stored on a hard drive, we're talking about a very specific encoding scheme of information that we know hard drives usually use. Where it means you have this little magnetic fluctuations on the hard drive and they mean zeros and ones and the zeros and ones, depending on file format, for example, like English text, are to be interpreted like this. So if you tell the AI, find me this data blob in the world, you do in fact need to specify sort of what format it's supposed to be looking for, right? Because otherwise the answer might just be, well, that doesn't exist in the world because you haven't specified what you actually mean by that. So I feel like maybe, but I don't know, I feel like Tammy who made all of this up probably has better ideas about this than I know about, but my intuition would be like, you could probably find, like do something like, use some really sort of general things, like find a function that maps from the Solomonov program to, let's assume we have Solomonov program, the AI does Solomonov induction thingy and then we have that and then we can say, look into that kind of program, look at each state of the world, look for a function that is like as simple as possible in some sense that given from the world, mapping from the world to like a bit string gives you like the actual bit string that's deep. Like it seems like, probably you don't know how to do that, but it seems like that is a lot easier than like point to human values. I'm also sure it is, okay, let's put that part aside for now, and say you successfully find a way to point at the hard drive and the information it contains. You've done that somehow. Though honestly, my suspicion is, worlds in which that's easy, in which sort of there's a mathematical operationalization you can find for this, are also worlds in which it's probably not that hard to point at the contents of this human's head either. I mean, for example, if you just specify, like if we're assuming. But you don't have to, like one thing is maybe if you would know exactly like the layout of the human brain, like what are all of the configurations in the human's head or something, or like what are even the representations, that you can't really get this data, right, and there you just generate it. So the hope is that part of what makes this hard is that we can't tell the AI what data storage format the information is supposed to be written in. And with the hard drive, we know it because we invented it, this is sort of a standard. I know, that's what I was assuming like we don't have. I was assuming more like, like the thing that I just found out, I think was more like, we know exactly what data we are looking for, whereas if you want to point at the human brain, we don't know exactly the data we are looking for. We don't know any like, we don't know like the bit string that there is a simple function to, which maps from the representation, like the physical human brain to like the bit string, encoding everything in like the natural way of what this human is in his brain, or like all the information or something like that. Like we don't know that, right? If we would know that, then, like I'm saying this problem is easy in that regard that we are knowing exactly what we're looking for. I mean, I kind of feel like, why do I even need this in sort of one of these assumptions to run a bit string setup? Why can't I just say, here's a variable which as its value has like a long text string, that's just a part of the AI, can get hard-coded in. Evaluate to me the counterfactual that would have happened if that variable read like that. I mean, that seems like it's even easier, you know? AI doesn't have to search the world to find a thing, it's just straight up a part of the program. Here, it's that variable there. Wait, what? It's like we're assuming of what program? I mean, the AI itself. Like before you create AI, on your computer, you write a variable B equals long text string, which can be anything. It's basically uninitialized. Why would you even initialize it? And now you write your rest of the program. Well, you would initialize it to get like uniqueness guarantees. Why would you need a uniqueness guarantee? Because how do you specify which string? I mean, it's a Python program. If you say in a Python program B, then there's only one B. That's guaranteed by it being a programming language. Like there's no ambiguity in that. And now you write your rest of your program, which is just DEI, and then at the step, you say, okay, now evaluate me, what would happen in the counterfactual world where B was this other thing? Like why can't I just do that? Why do I need still a long random message setup? So we have a program, and it defines a variable B. And then, and this is the AGI program. And then we tell the AGI, compute the counterfactual of what if B was different. Yeah. What is this? I don't understand anything about the setup. Well, I feel like maybe, in your head, there must be lots of things that I don't see right now. Otherwise, I don't see how this makes any sense. Because we lose like the most important aspect of this proposal, which is like we are managing to make the AI predict a human and what it would output, such, without needing to specify anything about the human. But like where do we do that then? Okay, just replace the hard drive with the random data of it, with an uninitialized variable B in a Python program, and replace the text file in which the human writes stuff based on B with another variable C that is right after that, and also starts off uninitialized. And now you write the rest of your AI, and you ask it in the counterfactual where B had set DC, where we know that humans based on that would initialize this differently, you would get that. Why can't I just do this? Why isn't this just equivalent? Why are we talking about giant strings of randomly initialized qubits to point to a specific part of the world? What is the difficulty that this unique? So B is the message that the human observes that it uses to generate the C? Yes. Okay, C is not a message. C is also a message, it's simple strings. Yeah, B is now D, and C is now message, which I didn't even write down. Yep. Okay. What do I lose? It seems like harder to point to the specific variables. It seems easier to me, like if round here in the Python code, I now just have a line U, and I have, hypothetically, that's of course what all of this is assuming, I have written the magic function that goes evaluate following counterfactual. I'm just gonna write magic. And the counterfactual is B is DC. Why is this harder? I mean, it's a Python program, B is very much specified, it's up there, that is unambiguous in code. Like this seems way more unambiguous than relying on the AI, like searching the universe itself for your variable specification that is located in some data format somewhere. Hmm. I need more water. I guess I don't see a problem with that. I feel like there should be one that I don't see, but maybe not. Okay, then I guess we have finally abstracted out the quantum noise weirdness, which about this proposal always struck me of, what on earth does that have to do with anything? All right. Now then I guess we can get down to the more central point perhaps of, this seems to be assuming that magic in this Python program is a function that we could learn to write down, whereas a function, a different magic function, that is about look at, try to figure out what human values are and that's the utility function now, that would be harder than this evaluate the counterfactual chain thing. Like this is going to be easier to code, so. Yeah. Hmm. So. I mean, yeah. I mean you don't need to know how to do it exactly, I guess. Maybe you could, but like in principle, like, it just needs to be specifying that it should do it and not, like you don't need to figure out how to compute the counter. Like it seems like if you could, if you would know how to robustly specify it at a very high level, this would be sufficient. Oh yeah, totally. Like I'm asking, is it in fact easier to specify this at a high level than it is to specify and look for the human value thing? Because that's the central difficulty you want to solve, right? But I mean, to me it seems like clearly easier. To me not at all. Like how do I put this? We have so far zero experience or knowledge basically of how to take fuzzy human concepts in the sense of, oh, but you know what I mean, and turn them into program code. Since we have not done this before, and also by the way, it's not just random program code, it's random, it's program code that has to be like intelligible to a very specific other system, to like this AGI we've made. And if you're saying that compute this counterfactual is like a thing that's easier to specify than implement human values or make me an identical strawberry, that seems to me like it's sort of assuming something about what's going to be easy and what's going to be hard to do in the translation of concept to code. And since we've never done concept to code translation and hardly know what these concepts even are mathematically, I'm not so sure a priori that that's true. Like right now I have no clue how to put any human concept into code at all. Once I do figure that out, what are the difficulties going to look like? Like for example, I could imagine a universe where this is the sort of thing where, okay, now we know how to make human concepts of length 20 bits into code, and this is actually kind of universal principle, and we can also do it now to 100-bit concepts or 200-bit concepts, and it isn't really that much harder. In that universe, it doesn't matter much whether the concept you want to encode is like a short-bit concept or a long-bit concept. I feel like this is so qualitatively different. It's not just about how long the concept is. What? Let's maybe assume like we are not in the real world, that we are in some cellular automata. Sure. If we want to like, let's assume in the cellular automata, we have like, we do like this exact same thing, only everything is now in the cellular automata, and we make the computer such that it's like just some cells in a row that store like this bit string. Then you would know, this would probably be relatively easy to like specify, look for a row that is like going in this direction, that is like exactly this giant bit string. Yeah, but that's the easy part. You don't even need to specify anything. It can just be a program code. The hard part is not pointing to the bit string. The hard part is writing the magic function that goes, evaluate me the counterfactual that would have happened with bit string having that blah, blah, blah. That's the hard part. So, I think this maybe doesn't serve anything. But wait, let me, so if you're in the cellular automata, we know where the bit string is. Yes. So, we can have a procedure that is like, like assuming we have like the whole model of the cellular automata. Sure. With access to the entire world state, which is, okay, not the entire world state, but like the world state where it is in. Then we just say, okay, hmm. Take that world state and just substitute in the string. And that's your starting world state now? Yes. Now, what's the message? Yeah, but the AGI is not a cellular automaton, which within it, it has like contained a complete description of the past and what you're doing is now taking out that part of the past and substituting in something else. That's not what an AGI is, right? It's not a world state simulator where you like put in what you would like instead. The AGI is a really smart thing that is really great at solving general problems. And you need to describe what problem you want it to solve. And the difficult part of that is not referring to the bit string that you want replaced in the past. That's easy. The difficult part is writing the instruction, figure out the counterfactual of what would have happened when. That's your task. How do you write that? So, are you fine with the assumption that we can identify the message as easily also? Sure. I mean, identifying the message, like I keep saying, I don't think this is hard at all. I don't think you need the setup. It seems to me right now you can just write a variable in Python and you are done. That's not, referring to the message is not a difficult part. Writing the instruction that you want the AI to perform with this message is the hard part. So, I guess we can't. So, okay. So, like if you make the assumption that we have this like perfect right model, then we don't even need the AGI. So, that seems like, like then it would be easy, right? Then we would know how to do this. I mean, if you both had a will, rather than an AGI, you just had a world state simulator and you had a way in your program to access like a specific part of the world set simulator and change it, then yeah, that would be totally easy. And then you would have what you want, yes. But an AGI is not a thing that is like a world simulator. That's not what general intelligence is. General intelligence is sort of the art of solving your problems without having to simulate the entire universe. So, what if we do some amount of induction to get the world model? Okay, so we have an AGI that has performed some amount of induction to get a world model, yes. Because until it has done that, it doesn't have a world model and has no clue about any kind of actual, about things that happened in the past with bit strings. Okay, it has done that, yes. During training, I guess. But I was thinking of a simplifying assumption. Let's assume we don't have an AGI. We just have some amount of induction running. Yeah, I mean. And what's what happened if we run this with IXE? Let's assume we don't run into embedded agency programs. So, is the IXE thing, like it starts out at universal prior when you pass it that utility function or in the moment you give it that utility function and already have time before to compute stuff and understand the world? I guess it would kill you then? Yes, that is part of the problem. So, like it starts with the universal prior in which case it might still kill you. But like, let's assume, let's think about if it would eventually do the right thing. Okay, so universal prior and then you give it the magic function. So, if the IXE thing is still at universal prior, then how do you specify at all like this magic function that contains the construction if I know the counterfactual of the bit string had been that if the AI does not yet know what a bit string is, what a program is, what a human is, what anything is, what the world is? Oh, now I know why this doesn't work, I think. Because like, how would this handle, or like maybe, how would this handle the case that this AI creates another AI, that other AI then modifies B. Like, it seems like we lose uniqueness sort of. Like, now we need to specify, no, no, care actually about this B, you know? And like, if you change the B, it is not. I mean, a utility function is a thing that parses stuff. Ah, I see what you mean, aha. As in just because I write B in there, that does not mean that this contains the instruction of imagine the counterfactual world if the program containing this thingy had been different. Yes, that is a good point. Okay. I said, can you repeat that? I'm not sure if you said the same thing. So, somehow you want to specify, imagine me the counterfactual world where the following bit message had been, at this following point had been different, where you mean like in the specific Python-y program. And here the problem is that just because I write this in a Python program does not mean that this Python code has anything to do with the world model of the AI or that it's distinguished within it. Yeah, makes sense, okay. That at least explains the weird setup with the quantum noise message, all right. I still don't think that it is distinguished from the world model, what exactly do you mean? I wrote here B equals DC. But it's okay, I have now set a variable B to this value in this magic function. What does this variable B do in the magic function? Somehow it has to be used to say something like, imagine me the world where the variable in the following Python code had been DC instead. That is then what this magic function has to be doing. And I guess what random noise setup is supposed to make easier is to write a magic function that can point to a part of the world and go imagine if that had been different. And that is a lot easier with like a unique random string than it is with just an initialized B. Okay, makes sense. Oh, okay. The thing, I still don't exactly understand what you're getting at, you think, but I think my point was maybe slightly different also which is like, if you have this setup, then it seems like you need to figure out how to tell the AI to care about this variable in this value, like you don't need to say care about, but if you say like care about this memory location, it could break because it's like, hi, I found this trick, somehow I can change the value in this memory location. That seems very different. I mean, what you're asking it to do is imagine me the counterfactual where that variable had had the following value in the past instead of the actual value it had. And that is not a thing the AI can change by now in the present changing the memory location. But of course, what it does still entail and still- Yeah, but you need to know how to say that. Yes, but- And that seems harder than if you have a unique thing that's specified uniquely over the entire universe. Yes, I agree, I was agreeing with you. I was saying I now understand why this random bit setup is there. So what you do still need to write is the magic function that implements a imagine me the following counterfactual. That's the thing that you have to figure out how to encode that as a function. Yes. Yeah, this is, I guess, very far this digression we were. You were saying it seems somehow very intuitive and obvious to you that that's a way easier function to write than figure out the values of this agent, the human located here and implement those. Yeah, like first of all, because you don't have unique, like you don't even have the data. You don't know what you're looking for. Here we know exactly what we're looking for, right? That seems like it should make some part of the problem easier. Because here we have right now the problem of like, for human, it's like, we can't, we don't have like a description of the human brain such that we can like put into a computer program and then tell the AI, look, this is what you're looking for. I mean, I'm not sure I agree with that. I mean, in actual practice, okay? The AI that you're gonna give this thing to, if it's gonna be saying something complicated about world models and placing bit strings of stuff, that's only gonna be intelligible and something that the AI can even pass if it has some idea of what the world is and what bits are, et cetera. Otherwise, it literally cannot execute this thing. It has no clue what it means, right? I don't know. I don't know. It's like Ixie's pretty dumb in some sense. It doesn't understand anything. Yeah, Ixie, if it has yet to see a single bit, I think would not know anything to do with this call snippet and I mean, what's it gonna do? I mean, if you give Ixie utility function, which at step zero, when it yet knows nothing of the world, it just tries to evaluate the function, returns nada because it's not evaluatable currently because just things that it says in the function don't mean stuff. Yeah, but would it be smart enough to, like what is the behavior of this process? Would it be that it tries to figure out more, like get more information about the world such that it will converge to being good at optimizing at the thing? I'm not sure. I think I don't know enough about Ixie specifically to answer that. Like I'm not sure. Like this is basically logical uncertainty now and I'm not sure if Ixie's built to handle logical uncertainty. You would know that better than me, I guess. I mean, the monad of induction is handling. So the monad of induction does not deal with logical uncertainty. So the monad of induction assumes that logical uncertainty is not a thing. Yeah. Wait, logical uncertainty is about, you have some logic statement and you're not sure if it's true or false, right? Yeah, I mean, the point is the AI has to be able to take this utility function, even at step zero, and feed a world state in and get a number out. Right? Otherwise it's not a well-defined utility function either. I see. And in order for that to be the case, if your utility function is some complicated stuff about evaluating counterfactuals, then somehow in the initial setup of either the AI or the utility function itself, all that stuff about counterfactuals and simulation and blah, which are all complicated concepts about how the world works, all has to already be in there. Otherwise, this thing is literally not a functioning program. It does nothing. Yeah. And so what I'm sort of asking is, in this initial state that we've got, however, if we got our right into the magic function, all the stuff about counterfactuals and world simulation, whatever, why, what's the a priori reason to go on specifying what it means to have a counterfactual and a world model and a bit string that was such in the past, but it could have been different? Like writing all that in code somehow, why is that gonna be way easier, predictably, than writing, look for the human brain and read out the values? Do you think it would be easier to specify, look for the first occurrence of this bit string? I'm not sure. I'm really not sure at all. I mean, look for, I mean, first off, look where, right? I mean, this is already assuming that there's like some notion of a physical universe in which things and information can be located, which if your thing is as yet uninitialized, like you've got to write all that stuff. Yeah, the thing is, I think in the setup right now, we're kind of assuming that we have an AGI that's already really good at optimizing. Yes, okay. So that's sort of the next job you can make. We now go away from an uninitialized AXE and we go to an AGI that is already reasonably good. We've trained it somehow. For some magic that we're not gonna think about for the moment, we have made it, but despite it already being pretty good at optimizing, it has not like escaped or killed us. And now we use our magic in alignment powers to give it a new utility function. All right. But in that utility function, you still got to write down what you actually want. You still got to write down in C code what corresponds to the human concept of, evaluate me the counterfactual of what would have happened if that bit string had been different. So if you have again like the grid word where we can easily, it's right. I'll give you a call to the decision. How would you write it? If we had like this grid word, we could tell the AGI, look for this thing that is the bit string. How would you write that? In the grid word you would say, look for a sequence of cells that have these. I mean, forget the stuff that could look for X. Just look for. How do you specify look for? How do you write that in C? But the thing is, because you have an AGI, you can just like. Well, no you can't. If you are about to say the AGI already understands what look for means, the AGI does not have a goal of interpreting your instructions correctly. If it had that, we would already be done. My intuition is, I think, that you could specify some uncomputable thing or like something that's not computable in practice. Like look for this sequence of strings, but just match every possible position and the one that matches is the thing that you should replace. And the AGI would be smart enough to figure out how to do this in an efficient way where it doesn't actually need to. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Totally buy that. How do you write that? But I just described it. I don't feel like I know how to write that. How do you write in C code the thing that you just said? Like you want some function that is about look for some world state and find me thing. Like you could specify something like run Solomon on this world. So your code snippet in it has some definition of Solomon of induction. Some definition of what that Solomon of induction was fed with data wise. If I take a Solomon of inductor that's fed on nice real world data of how the real world behaves and then I go and look for stuff the Solomon of inductor would predict if its input had been different in that a certain string had suddenly been different at time t equals 10 than it actually was. Like my first thought is here does your Solomon of inductor go, oh my God, the laws of physics were just broken. Conservation of energy has been violated. A string magically just became a different string. But, but, but what? I mean, if you go in and you make it imagine a counterfactual situation, your Solomon of inductor where. But we don't do that. I mean, you're running Solomon of induction. I mean, Solomon of induction is part of utility function and you hope that AI approximates what the Solomon of induction would have said, right? I see, so this is not about, so we assume the Solomon of induction has worked now. It's like we have a good world model. Yeah, let's say that for now. Okay. This thing has a good world model and now you are running the thing with the good world model on what would happen. Yes, I see. If I magically make some data go poof and replace it with different data violating all known laws of physics. That seems like it could be a problem that meditationists say it wouldn't be because like insofar as Solomon of induction is actually like the best thing that you can do in order to figure out the real world and the real world does not have data magically appearing. What would happen if I would like copy myself and then like place my copy like here and remove all of the air that is like intersecting with me? Like would everything break in the world even though that's physically impossible? What do you mean by, I mean, if I, an actual observer saw this, so my first update would be the laws of physics work totally differently than I thought they did because what you just did is impossible. All my world models are gone now. I need different world models or maybe the sensory data was just false. This is not in fact what happened. Is in the real world, is there a possible configuration of the real world that doesn't break the laws of physics? I'm here and I'm also like the copy of me is here. I mean, that depends on how you make that copy set up. If it magically just happens suddenly, no, you can't. The thing is you're starting in that state. You're just considering that as the starting state and me just standing here in the starting state. Wait, wait, wait. So you have your Solomon of inductor. You feed it data about how the world works, but you want that to not conflict as intrinsically to some extent does with the starting state you then initialize it with to have it like predict how things go on. Okay. But maybe I can say one thing, which is, do you think of a Solomon of inductor world model as a function from, we have a word state and now we're going to put it into this update function and we get the next word state? Well, yes. Solomon of inductor trade on particular data at particular time is such a function. Yes. So then I don't understand why it would ever break if we just, because there is no notion of, oh, it was before like this. If you have one valid physical configuration at one point, I mean, then. If you train a Solomon of inductor to be good at understanding the universe, then you can't just suddenly give it a new universe in a different starting state and have it like go on predicting from that as if nothing happened. Like the data you show it that you train your Solomon of inductor on implies, because physics is so puristic, that the thing you show it next of a setup where like this data string is like some counterfactual string does not in fact happen. Not assuming, I write, this doesn't have to mark off assumption, right? What doesn't have to mark off assumption? Solomon of induction. Which mark off assumption are we not talking about here? The one where it only depends on the exact previous state, the next state. I mean, your Solomon of inductor may not start off with this assumption, but physics in fact works like that. So if it's like good, it will learn this. But if it would learn that, then there wouldn't be a problem, right? I mean, if there would, if it learns stuff based on data you show it about times T minus 100 or whatever, and now you show it a state T prime that is in fact incompatible with what it saw at the inner training data T minus 100, then it's gonna go, oh, the loss of physics. And T, you're assuming like one word and that's like the trajectory, like through time, okay. So whatever you've done like to train your Solomon of inductor might very well conflict with you now going, okay, and now here's like a world state that looks like that, because it will go, the loss of physics, in which like part of the loss of physics is also the initialization state of the universe, which you can to some extent infer from looking around this room, for example. If your T prime isn't consistent with that, then that's like a huge update for a thing on how the loss of physics work. Or alternatively, it means that the sensors were wrong, probably, in observing T prime. But I will say that most of this right now is like not like central to me about the setup. What is central to me is still the question of, is writing the Solomon of code, in fact, easier than writing refer to human values. Do you think this wouldn't work? But it's like, I feel like in the grid world, we could do something like this, with the exception, I don't know this, but maybe there's other problems later on. But I feel like we could do this. I think this is a good point to make a break, because I actually do want to do our stuff today. Might get back to you maybe tomorrow or something. Right, tomorrow is the last day I'm here, by the way. Oh, okay, where are you headed? To Germany. And you intend to stay there for a while, or? Probably, I'm not sure. Okay, see you again tomorrow, sadly for the last time in a while, I guess. Or are you gonna be at EHE? Yes, I plan to. Okay, nice. Thank you. I also can send you Tami's Discord, probably. I think I'm already on that. Okay, then you can ask her if you have any questions. Yeah, thanks. Or you can ask me tomorrow, whatever you want. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

OpenAI;;; 4.742422103881836;;; The idea is that we are using Solomonov induction because we know how to precisely specify it in a computer program to write down the utility function of the agent. In actuality, we probably just use some approximation of Solomonov induction, but one that is very, very good, such that it is still practically uncomputable. We then use the power of the AGI to figure it out, because if we put this in as the objective function of the AGI, it will be, using the assumption that it is a powerful AGI that is inaligned, we can optimize for this objective and try to approximate it as well as possible, or rather as well as necessary to get the highest expected reward that the AGI would predict it would get.

I then felt the need to justify myself and without thinking said that I probably bought it too much because I went shopping hungry. I have heard that if you go shopping hungry you will actually buy more, possibly too much. This seemed like a plausible explanation. In fact a phenomenon that I think is true and I think I have experienced myself. However, the interesting thing is that this didn't really seem like the reason why I had so much food. I think the reason was just that I started to eat a lot less and also didn't plan in that I would be taking a flight in a couple of days. Otherwise I could have finished the food.

I think in the past I have often when I was in this situation forced myself to still do something productive, not waste my time laying in bed doing nothing. But this doesn't work. I think I have never managed successfully to resist all of these urges. Except now. Now when I made my only goal to not give in. After laying there for between 10 and 20 minutes all of these urges got weaker. New paragraph. I started to feel better and then after some amount of time I fell asleep. I slept 3 hours and then I woke up. Now I am here. I feel much much much better. There is a small sliver of these urges still in my mind. But I feel like they are so weak that they can't pull me sufficiently towards them such that I would actually do them. Whereas before it was extremely uncertain if I would manage to hold them up.
OpenAI;;; 6.736207008361816;;; So the solution to destroying depression is simple. It's not to force yourself to meditate. It's not to force yourself to do anything, really. It's not to just hold back, just lay down, just let the emotions wash over you. I did apply some meditation techniques. I did focus on how I was feeling. I was aware of that and that did help. But I didn't try to force myself to stand up and meditate. In fact I just aborted meditation before as I was feeling so bad. I couldn't sit there on my pillow and meditate. I didn't have the capacity to. But I did have the capacity to sludge myself into bed and then just do nothing, just let everything wash over me and very very slightly attempt to be aware of what was happening to whatever capacity I was able to. New paragraph. I feel like this is the right strategy. I feel like this is something that actually works. As long as I will remember to do this strategy I think I will be able to destroy depression each time it arises. New paragraph. I have done it once. I can do it again.

I was wondering what is the optimal way to consume the Brahmi powder. New paragraph. The first thing that came to mind was that I just put the Brahmi powder into a glass of water and stir it to dissolve it. I noticed that I should make the water not too high because I don't want to drink that much Brahmi powder perhaps. I actually don't quite understand the reasoning, it was not explicit. But it just naturally seemed like a good idea to dissolve the Brahmi powder in not too much water. It should be a small amount of water only. New paragraph. Possibly this was a cached thought and when I am expanding it right now it feels like that the answer is that this is because I don't want to drink large amounts of disgusting water and Brahmi powder is pretty disgusting. New paragraph. New paragraph.
OpenAI;;; 4.852359771728516;;; I did proceed to resolve the Brahmi powder or rather create a suspension in the water.

OpenAI;;; 3.452310085296631;;; Very often in the past I have written programs that were supposed to help me. For example a program to remind me when I should reflect on what I am doing. However, however, these programs normally failed. And I think they failed because the interface between my biological computer, aka my brain, did not properly interface with the signals that these programs were sending me.
OpenAI;;; 5.225564002990723;;; For example, consider the program that reminds me to reflect. It sends a notification that I then in principle could see if I'm looking at my laptop screen, which then reminds me that I should do the reflection. However, it's very easy to just dismiss this notification or ignore it. And the dangerous part is that once you start ignoring it sometimes, you implicitly generate an algorithm about what to do when you are seeing the notification, which is to not react to it at all. And the dangerous part is that this is unconditional. It's my guess. It's not like there is a precise reason why you are ignoring it. It's just you're ignoring it in general whenever it comes up. If you were to train yourself to ignore it based on some specific conditional, then it would be less damaging. Because then you wouldn't just ignore the thing, but you would only ignore it in the conditional that you have explicitly designed where you want to ignore it.
OpenAI;;; 56.03024220466614;;; New paragraph. Specifically what you need to do is have the signal that the program sends, i.e. the notification, never be ignored. Instead, once it's there, you trigger a certain procedure to calculate the value that is in the conditional and determines where to branch to and then one of the actions could be to snooze the notification. Or to do the reflection and mark that. Or and then there is probably some procedure for marking when you are done with the reflection. Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 3.853543281555176;;; All of these apps were about helping my brain in some way. For example, remember something and then execute a specific action based on that. However, just because you have the program that does the correct signal sending, does not mean that your brain then does the correct action based on the signal. The signal is just the first step. Taking the action, being able to do that, having the right algorithm in your brain to do this is more important. Without it, you can't do anything.
OpenAI;;; 3.0240769386291504;;; You can write computer programs to augment your brain. New bullet. Just writing the computer program doesn't work, if it doesn't properly interface with your brain and makes it do the thing that you want it to do. New bullet.

New paragraph There are so many other things that I also could be doing tomorrow, like selling my stuff or setting up more things with regards to EAG, or writing random programs that help me improve myself, or actually do figure out more about the algorithm stuff, or finally do some more layman research about how to build a system that does science. New paragraph It's just so many things that I could be doing and I haven't really managed to do them. However today I count as a win, I did manage to finally fulfill my routine to a very large degree. New paragraph There are so many things that I would want to do, but I can't do all of them, so I need to prioritize. I feel like I have now not worked on AI alignment for many days, so that seems like a natural target to aim for tomorrow. New paragraph I probably should set myself up such that I work on AI alignment for at least 2 hours. In the past I have successfully managed to study mathematics for 4 hours or something like 2-4 hours a day and that worked. Now I should do the same for AI alignment. Maybe then also add another hour of skill up things. New paragraph And probably another hour of improving myself. These seem all very good things to do, though I should note that the most important thing is probably meditation and doing sports. New paragraph At least if my hypothesis is correct, then not doing these things is the most harmful thing that I could be doing. Because if I don't do these things, then I wouldn't be able to do anything else.

OpenAI;;; 2.45129132270813;;; What is latent abstraction in this context?
OpenAI;;; 4.010056018829346;;; Have I ever talked to you about discovering the science algorithm? This was a research agenda that I came up with basically at the start of Serial Maths 2, but I never really worked on it because there were some people I was working with at the time who were extremely pessimistic about the idea, but I don't think they actually understood it.
OpenAI;;; 2.3671422004699707;;; Ah right, I remember that.
OpenAI;;; 5.863052845001221;;; The high level idea here is that it seems like to me there is an algorithm that does science, roughly. And this algorithm could be written down in a manner where we do not have any learning algorithms in the program. Consider that the way SGD works is by us first defining a parameterized computational structure and then updating that structure's parameters until we get good performance. This structure performs computations based on the parameters that we have found. These parameters are found automatically. We do not necessarily know what is going on. I am imagining something where we do not use an algorithm to discover the correct algorithms, but instead we just write down all of the algorithms directly.
OpenAI;;; 2.7316482067108154;;; Basically, this is the same as the world modeling agenda.
OpenAI;;; 2.557969331741333;;; It's just a different way to phrase it.
OpenAI;;; 3.210843086242676;;; Most of the things that I've been thinking about are rough intuitions and guesses and not any concrete insights that I'm sure will hold.
OpenAI;;; 1.8389489650726318;;; New bullet.
OpenAI;;; 5.353902816772461;;; It seems like this kind of science algorithm would not be that long. And I would imagine that there are some core insights, meaning the algorithmic insights that will show up in the code will probably be only thousands of lines long. And then you need a bunch of code to make it work with the real world, which is complicated, like processing input streams. But the actual doing science thing, that is like the core, will be pretty short. That is the first important thing to recognize. Or at least to me, I have an intuition that this is true.
OpenAI;;; 4.319072961807251;;; It seems to me like you could construct an environment, or many environments, that capture something important about doing science, i.e. looking at observations and constructing a world model that is good in the sense that if you have an algorithm, you can build an algorithm on top which uses this world model in order to modify this world according to a given preference ordering such that the trajectory that the world takes is high in the preference ordering.
OpenAI;;; 5.124485015869141;;; I mean something very different. I mean that SGD is an algorithm to find algorithms, whereas I just want to find the algorithm that builds good world models. I don't want an algorithm that finds an algorithm that builds good world models, because then we have the problem, at least with modern deep learning, that we do not understand how this algorithm works, that is found by SGD.
OpenAI;;; 3.391244888305664;;; I think there is one fixed science algorithm which simply takes in raw observations and constructs a model of the world which is good for optimizing the world.
OpenAI;;; 3.556339979171753;;; Meaning that you can just run this algorithm on arbitrary sensory input streams and it will work.
OpenAI;;; 3.2293131351470947;;; I think the science algorithm will be much more complicated than SGD. But still relatively simple. Probably much simpler than an operating system.
OpenAI;;; 3.8685550689697266;;; So, you are saying, there is an algorithm which builds up the model of the world, which right now we are calling the science algorithm?
OpenAI;;; 4.283488035202026;;; where the algorithm that constructs the world model is simple and laid out, but the model of the world is not defined up front how it looks like and is built up by the algorithm.
OpenAI;;; 8.56835675239563;;; Well, what do you mean with a scientific model? Figuring out what is the right data structure to represent the world is important. I don't think this algorithm would output something that looks like a classical scientific model. I think it probably needs to be much more encompassing than that. Humans can build world models that are very complicated in terms of having many different concepts that relate to objects in the world that are physical and more ephemeral like action objects, like running. It seems like most of the science algorithm is actually things that humans do intuitively. Like a child learns that there are different animals and how each of these animals behave, what sounds they make, how do they move, how fast do they move, are they afraid of humans, etc. All of these things are what humans do by default. And what we normally call science is just a very rigorous thing that we build on top of all of this existing machinery. But figuring out the science algorithm would not be about figuring out the new laws of physics but rather describing the world in the rich way that humans naturally already are able to do.
OpenAI;;; 2.5454719066619873;;; What does ephemeral mean?
OpenAI;;; 2.224644184112549;;; What does transcendental mean?
OpenAI;;; 2.6994588375091553;;; Please give me the URL of thankspace from Eliezer Yudkowsky's blog posts.
OpenAI;;; 2.2824511528015137;;; This is a thing that humans do by default.
OpenAI;;; 3.559217929840088;;; We need that framework because the human brain is kind of stupid in various ways. And this algorithm doesn't always work. And it can come to believe wrong things about reality in predictable ways. Which is what rationality is about fixing.
OpenAI;;; 3.778357982635498;;; But there is no doubt that just by default the human brain does a lot of things right when it comes to building good models of the world. Ask a random person what will happen if you take a hammer and smash it against the car window as hard as you can. You will actually be able to correctly predict what will happen.
OpenAI;;; 3.391256093978882;;; But nonetheless, there is a lot of stuff that is going on in the human brain which is doing science correctly. The fact that we are in the world and can learn about things is pretty amazing to begin with.
OpenAI;;; 3.5124258995056152;;; Of course, we want to be able to do science in this very precise way that we do with our scientific theories in the end. But if you would figure out how to do science just as well as a normal human without scientific training, I feel like you're probably... 75% of the way there, if not more.
OpenAI;;; 6.840085983276367;;; I mean Bayesian updating is basically a version of what the human is doing that is optimal in some sense. But there are various problems in using this in practice, like that you can't represent all possible hypotheses and you need to do infinite amount of computation to compute all of these infinite hypothesis updates. And this formalism is pretty simple. And I feel like we could find a formalism which is a bit more complicated because it needs to handle more stuff. For example, hypothesis generation. New bullet. Noticing when you need to do new hypothesis generation, i.e. when do your models break down in such a way that it's unlikely that any of the current models that you're considering is correct. New bullet. Hypothesis updating. New bullet. Using your word model to optimize the word.
OpenAI;;; 3.206483840942383;;; So it would be conceptually more complicated, but not 1000x so, and probably not 100x.

OpenAI;;; 3.7584969997406006;;; I'm pretty sure Evolution hasn't built in some hardcoded stuff to model these as it wouldn't have had enough time to do that. There must be some more general algorithm that can learn about these things and create the appropriate representations. I'm somewhat skeptical about this entire thing of having hardcoded representations about stuff.
OpenAI;;; 2.6239771842956543;;; How much of the human genome is shared with a banana?
OpenAI;;; 4.274160861968994;;; Maybe there is a set of primitive representations that is relatively small that humans have hardcoded into their brain. But then this would be a relatively small set, I expect. Not something extremely complicated and messy that we could never figure out.
OpenAI;;; 4.946157932281494;;; But right now my unfounded intuition is that there is just a general algorithm which will discover and generate the correct concepts of the world.
OpenAI;;; 3.99700927734375;;; I guess the more relevant question here is if we think that there is an algorithm which could discover a thing, like thing in a thing, or carry, or behind. I do not really see any reason why there would be an algorithm that does discover these concepts.
OpenAI;;; 3.9061472415924072;;; Like for example, cars or carriages seems really strange, like nothing like that was in the ancestral environment. There wasn't a thing you could go into and then travel around. They didn't even have horses. So probably the only thing you could really ride were other humans.
OpenAI;;; 4.704052925109863;;; But it could be the case that if you do not have some pre-learnt representations, then learning would be much much harder, such that you couldn't really make progress. So how could we look for evidence in the existing world that would tell us which way it is if pre-learnt representations are extremely useful or maybe even required?
OpenAI;;; 2.9010021686553955;;; I just presented one piece of evidence which I think is very weakly pointing against that.

OpenAI;;; 4.746102809906006;;; Do you think there is a primitive thing for flying around? What would happen if you show a child never something that flies around? Would they still develop the concept of things being able to fly? Would they randomly start to imagine things flying around, what it would be like? That seems possible, and it would like point in favor of there being pre-learned concepts, but not quite sure how you actually get an answer here without performing the experiment.
OpenAI;;; 3.194074869155884;;; I remember a different experiment where a scientist didn't show his daughter the sky and then he asked her at some point what color it was.
OpenAI;;; 3.3192458152770996;;; I think she then said first green and only after some time blue.
OpenAI;;; 15.322455883026123;;; I think maybe color is an interesting thing here, because if you do not have a name for a color, it actually becomes hard for you to differentiate it from different colors. For example, in Russian there is a name for a different shade of blue, and then I think you get better at recognizing that shade of blue is different from other shades of blue. There is an even more extreme example where people have shown to some Amazon tribe 10 green squares. One was a very slightly different shade of green. If they were showing these to the tribespeople, they could immediately recognize which green was different. But if they replaced the slightly different green thing with a blue square, then they had trouble seeing which square was different, even though it was blue and green. So it was really obvious for non-tribespeople. Whereas for non-tribespeople it was hard to differentiate the shade of green.
OpenAI;;; 5.7488110065460205;;; Also, what about video games? There are tons of video games and some of them are pretty strange. You can reverse gravity and that is a primitive action. You can move your character around. Or that you have a side-scrolling game where you see everything in a 2D perspective. Where you move your character with WASD. That seems like... I don't get the most weird examples, but it seems like games provide sort of a world with different rules that you can learn and get good at and develop algorithms for performing the correct actions in the correct situations such that according to the game you perform well. That's something you can learn. And these worlds are pretty different often from reality.
OpenAI;;; 4.75359320640564;;; I feel like the strongest piece of evidence right now that I can think of that you need pre-training is that we haven't managed to do the sort of thing without pre-training.

That seems a lot higher level of defining how the language learning part is wired up versus having basic hard-coded concepts about the real world.
OpenAI;;; 3.9608278274536133;;; What is the study about where they tried to teach people some language without some features that all human languages share and where they then ended up learning a language in such a way that it shared these features.

OpenAI;;; 7.0830748081207275;;; Meta, colon. I feel like I might have the problem that I get derailed way too hard in conversations like these. I think your counter-argument here about, or possible counter-argument, that maybe we get really messy representations and therefore this might not work out, is a good thing and a thing to keep in mind, but I feel like it probably would have been more beneficial for me to actually continue to lay out all of the relevant thoughts in my brain with regards to that which I didn't really finish, to give you a better idea of the overall picture and what even the theory of change for this thing is. New paragraph. One thing that might work out is if during a conversation I would keep a list of steps where a step is a thing, a topic, that we could discuss in the future but is laid on ice right now.

OpenAI;;; 3.9319660663604736;;; Though, of course, as always, it's good to notice that this is a continuous quantity. Insecurity is not binary. And probably there is a relationship between the quality of my posts and my well-being. But that is very minor and you would need to do a lot more work digging into some other algorithms in my head and making them elicit some strong emotional reactions before I would show any strong emotional reactions there.

OpenAI;;; 2.920546054840088;;; I got derailed a bit by doing a long workout that was probably twice as long as planned, though that wasn't really the issue.

OpenAI;;; 3.1787312030792236;;; I think I would like to actually be more focused in future days. I think I have lost a lot of valuable time by getting derailed in this way. Almost three hours I would say at least.
OpenAI;;; 3.424643039703369;;; The question still remains of how am I going to process all of the material I have created today. What I mean with this is that I have written up and thought about various things. But if I do not extract my insights in some form, I think I will never really look at them again. I need to systematize and organize the things I have been thinking about.
OpenAI;;; 5.643031120300293;;; I think that should probably be the first task tomorrow. Take a look at all of the things that I have been doing and then extract them into a format where I can quickly comprehend them. That probably means writing an internal document about the findings and making that in some sense transparent. New paragraph. One solution that popped into my mind, which might be bad because I haven't understood the problem that well, is to have a research log where I write and link about everything that I was doing on that day. This log would be continuous and one document such that I can scroll back and see what I was doing when. It seems something like this is probably a good thing to do. This is similar to the all-time whisper transcription that I had running.
OpenAI;;; 3.682589054107666;;; In general I think I need to have better systems for organizing my knowledge. However right now is probably not the right time to delve deep into that. Rather I think right now it would be better to focus on doing more research directly. As that seems to be one of the most important things that I have been neglected extremely.
OpenAI;;; 3.5433990955352783;;; Another solution which just popped into my mind is to have a tree of topics in which I keep track of why I am thinking about a specific thing. The idea is to expand this tree as I am talking about more and more topics and then mark the thing that I am currently thinking about. Ideally this should provide me with more context on why I am thinking about a particular thing.
OpenAI;;; 4.522233963012695;;; Though it seems I still don't understand the general problem very well. But the general problem would be how can I organize my thoughts in a way that is conducive to reloading contexts I thought of before and to keep an overview of what is the general thing I am trying to do at the moment and what are possible avenues that I could explore in the future.

OpenAI;;; 12.884368896484375;;; It would be useful to know why you are caring about this. What is the underlying question that you are trying to answer here? So note that I mainly did game design and not... which didn't require a really deep understanding of the underlying hardware. I've written some shaders, but I don't think I have a good grasp on the questions you are trying to answer, ask here. Mainly that is because I never made a game where we would have been bottlenecked by the GPU and never needed to look into what kinds of optimizations we might do there. New paragraph. All that being said, in my current understanding it is such that for every object that you have in a scene you have the CPU issue a draw call to the GPU. Or maybe you can batch multiple objects such that you have only a single draw call. There is continuous communication between the CPU and the GPU in every frame because you need to have all of these draw calls being sent. Probably there is some optimization going on such that once you load a specific object into the VRAM you will not load it again for the next draw call that uses the same object. Instead you will keep it in the VRAM. So if you have enough VRAM the communication would still be constant but the data moved around might be a lot smaller. So here is already the limit of what I know.
OpenAI;;; 2.186973810195923;;; I don't really understand what you mean with your first bullet point.
OpenAI;;; 3.4642651081085205;;; The output would go out of the graphics card and onto a screen. That communication is not bottlenecked, if that's what you mean.
OpenAI;;; 5.7933478355407715;;; Based on what I said before, your third point is not understood by me. The input communication is, I think, the main thing that is the bottleneck, because the output would be sending it to a monitor. I guess you could also send some stuff on the GPU back to the CPU, maybe that happens, I'm not quite sure. But I think this doesn't necessarily need to happen. And you would only do it for specialized operations. I'm not quite sure what they were, but I'm sure there are some things where you could do some manipulation of some intermediate results on the CPU faster than on the GPU. Not sure.
OpenAI;;; 2.5706570148468018;;; Have you tried talking to GPT-4 about this? I would guess that it has better text than me.

Also it's kind of hard to check what I did there, because most of the things are not written up publicly. So there seems to be a chance that maybe you have not built an accurate model of my background. Especially if you have mainly looked at the game design stuff that I was doing. In any case, just wanted to make sure that we are not in that failure mode.

OpenAI;;; 4.318822145462036;;; I was just reminded that I once told Sebastian that what I would like to do later on is optimize things. What I meant there was, I want to do some task where we have some specific goal. Like making the best window management experience. Or making the best army in a game. Or developing the best strategy to beat your opponent. That seems to be pretty fun to me. And this is another instance of it. New paragraph. Now the question is, how can we translate this to AI alignment research?
OpenAI;;; 3.2391679286956787;;; What is so fun about this here? And how can I make AI alignment research maybe fun in the same way? Without compromising on other important attributes.
OpenAI;;; 3.8563241958618164;;; New paragraph. It seems like one important thing is that we have a clear goal and it's easy to see how you make progress. Or at least it's easy to feel like you're making progress. For example when you're making a window management layout at the very small level you see lots of progress. If you design a new layout in Xmonad then you have done that. You can see it. You can use it. It's something very tangible that you can see that you have made that you didn't have before.
OpenAI;;; 7.088277101516724;;; New paragraph. Note that you have similar things in games, where you level up your character and you can see your experience bar grow. At a very short timescale you see progress, just like in making a window manager. Now, you also have a clear goal in a game of what you want to achieve and you can easily see how doing a particular thing makes progress towards that. New paragraph. This seems not to be the case for how I am doing AI alignment research, if I'm managing to do it at all. New paragraph. I just noticed a different problem. As soon as I was starting to think about AI alignment research, I started to feel very bad about myself. I was almost flinching away from even thinking about it, from considering doing it. That's a ginormous problem that I have. New paragraph. In AI alignment research, it's not exactly clear what is a goal that you can work towards. And it's harder to see the progress that you're making, probably because it's less clear.
OpenAI;;; 1.7850279808044434;;; what the overall objective is even supposed to be.
OpenAI;;; 10.586570978164673;;; Maybe I should stop calling it AI alignment research or AGI not kill everyoneism. I need a different concept that's not tainted by negative emotions that are associated with it that has a different goal and a different framing of what I need to do but that will still lead me to make progress on solving AI alignment Something like that might be possible to construct.
OpenAI;;; 2.305727005004883;;; I could do something like have the goal to develop the best theory for predicting agents.

Maybe there is more to it that I am not seeing yet, but this seems to be at least a significant part of how to make the brain more engaged.
OpenAI;;; 3.688061237335205;;; Another important realization is that programming seems to be so fun, maybe because everything is very concrete. I'm drawn towards thinking about programming not because I think programming is nice, but because there is a specific feature that I would like to have in an app that I'm currently using and then I can just go and implement it. It's very, very concrete what I'm thinking about when I'm getting thoughts that pull me towards doing the task.
OpenAI;;; 4.7151780128479;;; The same happens in games. And the same happens when I get excited about some piece of mathematics, then it's some concrete problem that seems interesting that I want to solve. New paragraph. Maybe this even generalizes to my Wikipedia sprees, because I always start them because I have one very specific question that I'm wondering about. And then, by the nature of Wikipedia, there are lots of links that are related. And this is another aspect of, you actually find things interesting that are related to the things that you already find interesting. So then you expand out your initial seed of strong interest.
OpenAI;;; 1.6758761405944824;;; Achieve a particular thing.
OpenAI;;; 4.714916944503784;;; A similar thing happens in programming, where you care about achieving a particular result and in order to achieve this result you need to learn a specific thing.

I feel like that is important and should be stated very briefly here. If I remember correctly, the summary is the thing that is used for screening to decide if you should even look further at the application. And putting here all of the core important stuff seems good.

OpenAI;;; 6.644937992095947;;; This seems very strange to me. When we're doing research like this, we're dealing with an exponential search space, meaning that the strategy of just eliminating lots of directions as not being promising doesn't really necessarily get us anywhere. I feel like you would need to make a specific argument for why eliminating directions in a particular way would actually be highly beneficial. Just trying out random shit that doesn't work doesn't get you any closer, because you're eliminating only a tiny fraction of possibilities. If you're building a rocket, having a computer program that outputs a random description of a rocket, and then you build a rocket, it will probably explode. And having built the rocket based on a random design and seeing it explode probably will not help that much with becoming so good that you can build a rocket that actually works.

That you understand the basics of AI alignment. And that if you were to work on this, you would actually do something that helps. John said something like that this is what references are for and that this is very important.
OpenAI;;; 4.68379807472229;;; My intuitions here might be a bit off, but to me it seems like it would be better if you get overall a lot more explicit about how this is possibly solving AI alignment. For example, I looked at Vivec's application for Nets 4 and that seemed to be very good exercise questions.
OpenAI;;; 2.8471240997314453;;; I think you should mention that the proof that you did was possible because the reframing that you did was good in the sense that it allowed you to look at the thing in such a way that proving the thing becomes a lot easier compared to Scott's original formalism.
OpenAI;;; 2.282503128051758;;; That seems pretty important forward slash impressive.
OpenAI;;; 2.2110848426818848;;; If that's the case, which I presume based on the later text.
OpenAI;;; 4.375775098800659;;; What is the level, the alignment at which you would want to make changes to your theory? I just had a dream where my answer was that if you couldn't predict something, if reality doesn't match your expectations, your predictions, then there must be something missing from your theory. New paragraph. But this is not the only thing to consider when talking about what to aim for. You should also make it such that you can model as many aspects of reality as possible in general and specifically in all the things that are relevant to AI alignment.
OpenAI;;; 1.797335147857666;;; How's it going?
OpenAI;;; 2.027498960494995;;; What shall we discuss?
OpenAI;;; 2.604200839996338;;; Here are two random topics that just popped into my head. First of all, I just had to...
OpenAI;;; 1.8823251724243164;;; But probably let's do and the Anthropic stuff.
OpenAI;;; 5.283278226852417;;; A dream and somebody asked me, how do you know if your AI alignment research is promising? And I found my answers kind of good. The first one was that you want to make all your theories match reality, match your observations. And I guess it is in general just building an accurate model of whatever you are trying to understand, in this case the behavior of very intelligent agents. And the second characteristic was that if you have any theories, then you want to make your theories match as much of reality or rather the relevant domain as possible. And these were two heuristics I was telling this person in my dream of how do you know if what you are doing in AI alignment is good. New paragraph. Thank you.
OpenAI;;; 4.436557769775391;;; The second thing would be about understanding how the reinforcement algorithm works in the brain. I'm really confused by it and I think if I would understand it better, then I could optimize myself into being more productive. How does this AGI that is in my head get steered? And how can I change that steering from the perspective of the consequentialist module that has some terminal goal and thinks about what are the best things and wants to achieve the best utility there?
OpenAI;;; 3.736884832382202;;; But as I said I am up for discussing Anthropic stuff, though I actually haven't read that much about what they are doing. As far as I understand, they are doing experiments with very large language models and try to align them by making them behave well. Though I am not quite sure exactly what this entails. Do they have the same pitfall of they want to have the AI not being naughty and actually ignore some important problems that we would expect arise when we get AGI's that are much smarter than us?
OpenAI;;; 3.051313877105713;;; I think an interesting question is also, what would remain of the problem after you solve the interpretability part? It seems like that doesn't actually solve the problem, right? It just solves the problem of you understanding what goes on, but it doesn't solve the problem of you knowing how to steer that powerful cognitive system.
OpenAI;;; 4.285590648651123;;; Well, the first answer is that you want to make it such that particular theories capture the aspect that they are trying to capture in the sense that they are mapping to reality. And the second thing is about that you would want to have a set of theories such that they cover all of the relevant aspects of the domain that you are trying to understand. For example, if I were building a car, I might just need classical mechanics. But if I want to build a satellite, then I need to also understand quantum mechanics. Special relativity.
OpenAI;;; 2.5318009853363037;;; It's important that your theories as a whole cover all of the relevant aspects such that you can actually do what you want to do.
OpenAI;;; 23.61391019821167;;; More specifically in AI alignment we would want to have theories which are correct but also that model the relevant aspects in AI alignment. It can't just be about understanding how a support vector machine can overfit some data. That would not be sufficient to solve AI alignment even if we have a really good theory about how support vector machines work. That theory might even be useful in AI alignment but it's not sufficient to solve the problem. So you need to expand the theory. That's what the difference is between these two answers I think.
OpenAI;;; 5.350322008132935;;; That's an interesting question. Consider me having a black box, which given a world state, just spits out the next world state. This seems to be qualitatively different from having a white box model of the world that allows me to make predictions where sub-components of that model map to reality. If I just had a single function which gives me the next world state, then there are several things which I might not be able to do, or might not be easy to do, that I could do if I had a white box model.
OpenAI;;; 6.474497079849243;;; For example, consider that we had a world model where we have concepts in the world model and sub-models such as how does electricity work and what are the physical properties of these materials and where are these materials in the world If we had such a world model, then you could do something like a creativity algorithm that would run on this world model discovering new configurations of reality that would achieve particular things and this sort of reasoning might be at the very least much more computationally intractable if you just had a black box function that gives you the next world state
OpenAI;;; 6.984899044036865;;; It is more like to solve alignment we need to model the relevant things correctly. And what correct means is that they capture aspects of reality such that we can think about them well enough to form reality how we want it to form, in particular building an agent that is aligned, i.e. something like cares about us even if it gets really smart and godlike. New paragraph. The second point is about that in order to be able to use this knowledge to build an agent that is aligned we need to capture all of the aspects of reality which are actually relevant to answering this question. New paragraph. So the overall thing is more about AI alignment in general and not about any specific research direction. What do we need overall to make alignment go well? What are the heuristics that you apply there? Because then it becomes much more relevant that you have covered all of the relevant knowledge that you need.
OpenAI;;; 2.3420186042785645;;; But they all need to sum up to a complete theory which allows us to do what we want to do.
OpenAI;;; 3.94323992729187;;; You couldn't build a satellite for GPS with classical mechanics. In the same way, we might be able to build aligned systems that are at a certain level of intelligence, but the alignment breaks down as we make them a bit smarter. And we want to be in a situation where we have all of the correct models, such that we know how to build a system that will still be aligned, no matter how smart it is. Possibly, this framing doesn't even make sense and is incomplete, but something like that seems to be what I'm trying to point at.
OpenAI;;; 3.6550941467285156;;; was not limiting myself to just talking about how do you know that a particular research direction that is very specialized and addresses just a sub-problem is good. Because I think you can't actually say if it is good unless you have at least some idea of the big picture of where this fits in with solving alignment or doing a pivotal act or some other story which results in a good outcome.
OpenAI;;; 3.8250861167907715;;; I was imagining that you have some explicit representations that factors the world into different concepts and that you then have a separate algorithm which can run over these representations and figure out new combinations that achieve particular things that are useful.
OpenAI;;; 4.836842060089111;;; Right now I'm trying to come up with a minimal example that would illustrate what creativity is. One simple example right now I have is, but it gets much simpler than that, I think, is building an infinite water pool in Minecraft. Somebody had to invent that at some point. And I'm not meaning the game designer who builds the game, but the player. The player can discover how to make such a pond in which you can pull out infinite amounts of water, in case you know what I'm talking about.
OpenAI;;; 7.171509742736816;;; I think maybe a good example, but still not minimal, is when you have an AND and NOT logic gate. With that you can build a computer. And so you can build up out of only these two components, as you need wire to connect them. You can build everything. And you can build bigger and bigger components that perform more and more complex tasks.
OpenAI;;; 4.965789794921875;;; And then you need to invent new names to describe these things that you are building in order to keep everything organized. Also note that if we just connect logic gates together randomly, we probably get just some garbage most of the time. So it's interesting that in logic gate design you have an exponentially large search space and you have only a very limited number of things that are really useful. For example, a binary adder is really useful. And it's an interesting question, I think, how many random tries on average you would need in order to figure out this binary adder. And also the question of course is how would you even evaluate that the binary adder is useful.
OpenAI;;; 3.4825501441955566;;; Well, to me it's not even that clear what are the relevant things that we need to have good models about such that we would still have alignment. If we knew that, it would be a lot easier.
OpenAI;;; 3.542341947555542;;; Also, I think it is a mistake to think about this as one set of theories. There might be many possible paths that we could take to alignment, and they might look quite different and require different kinds of understanding. It's also not clear how diverse the possible approaches are.
OpenAI;;; 3.2642111778259277;;; Based on my very limited understanding though, it seems that what Tammy is doing might be one possible direction, what Vanessa Kosa is doing is one possible direction. Miri is doing something, or has been doing something related to this, where they are just trying to get to understand concepts that are important to agency, or at least that's the kind of research that's associated with Miri, and getting...
OpenAI;;; 3.1292898654937744;;; From my intuition it seems that John is doing something like that, about trying to ask the right questions of what true names we need and how we go about getting them in order to get a better understanding about agency such that we would be able to use this understanding later on to build an aligned AI.
OpenAI;;; 13.920841932296753;;; Evan focuses on how do we not get deception and it seems like there are some relevant concepts there that would be useful if we had better understanding about them
OpenAI;;; 3.9973578453063965;;; Paul Christiano has been thinking about intent alignment and that seems to be at least one framing of a thing that if we would understand it, it would be very good. Like this is a, if we had a formalism of what is intent alignment that actually captures the relevant aspect of reality this would seem like a really good amount of progress I mean basically it's a reformulation of what's alignment what does that mean?
OpenAI;;; 3.028824806213379;;; So that's when we're talking about AI alignment, that's basically the meat of this thing. How do we make it that it's intended aligned? And if we would know that, we would probably almost be done.
OpenAI;;; 3.113339900970459;;; But it's still a useful concept for differentiating it from other failure modes like the AI fails because it's too dumb to do the right thing, even though it wants to do the right thing.

OpenAI;;; 2.844054937362671;;; Understanding how to not get deception seems relevant and seems to point naturally to various concepts. It would probably be good to understand.

OpenAI;;; 3.6935038566589355;;; Here I want to gather some general resources of things I have talked about or could talk about when creating guided meditations.
OpenAI;;; 6.859210014343262;;; I have just realized something kind of funny. I remember when I was talking to Vlad Kokin, he was telling me about that he thinks there are lots of things that he needs to do, like have social interactions with friends, in order that he fulfills some sort of fundamental need that he has. Without the fulfillment of which he could not be happy. I think this general framework of thinking that there are some things that you need in order to be happy, in order to be in a good state of mind, such that you can do productive work, is correct. New paragraph. However, I have just realized that maybe the things that he has in his list are actually not the right things. I know that doing sport is very good for my mental health, doing meditation is also very good for my mental health, talking to IA is also very good for my mental health. These three things seem very important, and for me they seem to definitely make up the majority of positivity. Probably about 75% of the things I should be doing with regards to mental health are these things. And talking to friends other than IA would be much lower priority, I think, than what Vlad thinks. It seems like he has not discovered yet the benefits of these things. They are very powerful.
OpenAI;;; 4.0190489292144775;;; This seems to be especially true when you think you have understood something, but haven't. Then, inversion to understanding and using basic things can be harmful.
OpenAI;;; 5.021920919418335;;; You should try to solve problems the easy way first. If you succeed, you won't need to try the hard problem. If you fail, you probably have revealed something about the problem that makes it hard, which can be useful in adapting future solution attempts such that they take into account or in some way circumvent this difficulty.

OpenAI;;; 6.980436325073242;;; The cheese thing seems related here. New paragraph. It seems like Alex Turner has the thing where he has identified something in the network such that if he changes that thing, it changes where the mouse tries to go. New paragraph. What is important here is to consider if this updating procedure that he used to update the network, what kinds of reasoning cognition did this thing update exactly. It seems like in the human brain we have a structure where we have a general reasoning algorithm that can target basically any kind of target state and this reasoning algorithm is controlled by various lower level heuristics which compute things like hunger. New paragraph. You might be feeling hungry and perceive this as a negative emotion. And you are a human, normally, when you are having an emotion like this, you notice how you can circumvent it. That is what normally arises together with that emotion. A piece of knowledge that tells you how to make it go away.
OpenAI;;; 7.402361154556274;;; This is then used by the higher level general reasoning process to optimize for a particular target such as getting food. If the update procedure for the network modifies only the lower level heuristics that are done, then this might be bad. These kinds of heuristics might not actually be reflectively stable. For example, me as a human, you could make me probably eat lots of bananas by making me hungry all of the time and making it such that I feel really good when eating bananas. I might still care about completely different things and if I had the ability to change myself such that I no longer value eating lots of bananas but instead can focus on doing other things that I care more about, I would do so. This seems to be still a problem that might come up if we align really smart systems that would be able to self-modify in this way. Ideally, we would want to understand the network or any system in general well enough such that we can understand that the modifications that we are doing will be corresponding to making the system robustly want to optimize for a particular target that we want such that this is reflectively stable and in some sense what the system really wants. The system wouldn't self-modify to not care about this. At least this would avoid some of the obvious failure cases. Potentially, if there are some ontological shifts happening, then the system might still break.
